* Changes in income


** Variations in income

#+MATS: figcol fig-3A_1004-crc2-*.pdf 0.55

- As income increases, $M < M' < M''$, the budget line
  shifts to the right.


** Changes in the consumption decision

#+MATS: figcol fig-3A_1004-crc3-*.pdf 0.55

- The consumer chooses a different basket for each level of monetary
  income.


** Income-consumption curve

#+MATS: figcol fig-3A_1004-crc-*.pdf 0.55

- The *income-consumption curve*, \CRC, is the set of baskets a
  consumer chooses for every possible value of the monetary income,
  keeping constant the prices of the goods.


** Engel curve

#+MATS: figcol fig-3A_1004-eng-*.pdf 0.55

- The *Engel curve* relates the demanded quantity of a good to the
  monetary income of a consumer, keeping constant the prices of the
  goods.


** Normal and inferior goods


- The consumption of *normal goods* increases as income rises. The
  slope of the Engel curve is positive:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \frac{\diff X}{\diff M} > 0 \]
  #+end_export

- The demanded quantity of *inferior goods* decreases as income
  increases. The slope of the Engel is negative:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \frac{\diff X}{\diff M} < 0 \]
  #+end_export



* Variations in the price of a good


** Changes in the price of a good

#+MATS: figcol fig-3A_1004-cpc2-*.pdf 0.55

- When the price of good $X$ decreases, $P_X > P'_X > P''_X$, the
  budget line shifts counterclockwise.


** Changes in the consumption decision

#+MATS: figcol fig-3A_1004-cpc3-*.pdf 0.55

- The consumer chooses a different basket for each $P_X$.


** Price-consumption curve

#+MATS: figcol fig-3A_1004-cpc-*.pdf 0.55

- The *price-consumption curve* is the set of the baskets a consumer
  chooses for every possible price of good $X$, keeping constant the
  monetary income and the prices of other goods.


** Individual demand curve

#+MATS: figcol fig-3A_1004-dem-*.pdf 0.55

- The *demand curve* relates the demanded quantity of a good with the
  price of that good, keeping constant the monetary income and the
  prices of other goods.


** Substitutes and complements

- The \CPC{} also shows how the consumption of $Y$ varies as the price
  of $X$ varies, /ceteris paribus/.

- Good $X$ is a *substitute* of good $Y$ if the demand of $Y$
  increases as the price of $X$ rises:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \frac{\diff Y}{\diff P_X} > 0 \]
  #+end_export

- Good $X$ is a *complement* of good $Y$ if the demand of $Y$
  decreases as the price of $X$ increases:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \frac{\diff Y}{\diff P_X} < 0 \]
  #+end_export
