* Changes in income


** Variations in income

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t15-crc2.pdf 0.55

- As income increases, $M < M' < M''$, the budget line
  shifts to the right.
- Prices do not change: the budget lines are parallel.


** Changes in the consumption decision

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t15-crc3.pdf 0.55

- The consumer chooses a different basket for each level of monetary income.


** Income-consumption curve

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t15-crc.pdf 0.55

- The *income-consumption curve*, \CRC, is set up by the baskets that
  a consumer chooses for each possible value of the monetary rent,
  keeping the prices of goods constant.


** Engel curve

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t15-eng.pdf 0.55

- The *Engel curve* relates the demanded quantity of a good to the
  monetary rent of a consumer, keeping constant the prices of goods.


** Normal and inferior goods


- Consumption of *normal goods* grows when income increases. The slope
  of the Engel curve is positive in this case.
  \[ \frac{\diff X}{\diff M} > 0 \]
- Demanded quantity of *inferior goods* decreases as income
  increases. The slope of the Engel curve of an inferior good is
  negative.
  \[ \frac{\diff X}{\diff M} < 0 \]



* Variations in the price of a good


** Changes in the price of a good

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t15-cpc2.pdf 0.55

- When the price of good $X$ decreases, $P_X > P'_X > P''_X$ the
  budget constraint pivots on the point $M/P_Y$ to the right.
- The slope of the budget line is less pronounced the smaller is the
  price of $X$.


** Changes in the consumption decision

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t15-cpc3.pdf 0.55

- The consumer chooses a different basket for each $P_X$.


** Price-consumption curve

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t15-cpc.pdf 0.55

- The *price-consumption curve* includes the baskets the consumer
  chooses for each possible price of good $X$, keeping constant the
  monetary rent and.


** Individual demand curve

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t15-dem.pdf 0.55

- The *demand curve* relates the demanded quantity of a good with the
  price of that good, keeping constant the monetary rent and the price
  of the other goods.


** Substitutive and complementary goods
- The \CPC{} also shows how the consumption of $Y$ varies as the price
  of $X$ varies, /ceteris paribus/.
- Good $X$ is a *substitute* of good $Y$ if the demand of $Y$
  increases when the price of $X$ does so:
  \[ \frac{\diff Y}{\diff P_X} > 0 \]
- Good $X$ is a *complement* of good $Y$ if the demand of $Y$
  decreases when the price of $X$ increases:
  \[ \frac{\diff Y}{\diff P_X} < 0 \]
