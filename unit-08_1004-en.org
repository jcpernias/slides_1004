* Changes in income


** Variations in income

#+MATS: figcol fig-08_1004-crc2-*.pdf 0.55

- As income increases, $M < M' < M''$, the budget line
  shifts to the right.


** Changes in the consumption decision

#+MATS: figcol fig-08_1004-crc3-*.pdf 0.55

- The consumer chooses a different basket for each level of monetary
  income.


** Income-consumption curve

#+MATS: figcol fig-08_1004-crc-*.pdf 0.55

- The *income-consumption curve*, \CRC, is the set of baskets a
  consumer chooses for every possible value of the monetary income,
  keeping constant the prices of the goods.


** Engel curve

#+MATS: figcol fig-08_1004-eng-*.pdf 0.55

- The *Engel curve* relates the demanded quantity of a good to the
  monetary income of a consumer, keeping constant the prices of the
  goods.


** Normal and inferior goods


- The consumption of *normal goods* increases as income rises. The
  slope of the Engel curve is positive:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \frac{\diff X}{\diff M} > 0 \]
  #+end_export

- The demanded quantity of *inferior goods* decreases as income
  increases. The slope of the Engel is negative:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \frac{\diff X}{\diff M} < 0 \]
  #+end_export



* Variations in the price of a good


** Changes in the price of a good

#+MATS: figcol fig-08_1004-cpc2-*.pdf 0.55

- When the price of good $X$ decreases, $P_X > P'_X > P''_X$, the
  budget line shifts counterclockwise.


** Changes in the consumption decision

#+MATS: figcol fig-08_1004-cpc3-*.pdf 0.55

- The consumer chooses a different basket for each $P_X$.


** Price-consumption curve

#+MATS: figcol fig-08_1004-cpc-*.pdf 0.55

- The *price-consumption curve* is the set of the baskets a consumer
  chooses for every possible price of good $X$, keeping constant the
  monetary income and the prices of other goods.


** Individual demand curve

#+MATS: figcol fig-08_1004-dem-*.pdf 0.55

- The *demand curve* relates the demanded quantity of a good with the
  price of that good, keeping constant the monetary income and the
  prices of other goods.


** Substitutes and complements

- The \CPC{} also shows how the consumption of $Y$ varies as the price
  of $X$ varies, /ceteris paribus/.

- Good $X$ is a *substitute* of good $Y$ if the demand of $Y$
  increases as the price of $X$ rises:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \frac{\diff Y}{\diff P_X} > 0 \]
  #+end_export

- Good $X$ is a *complement* of good $Y$ if the demand of $Y$
  decreases as the price of $X$ increases:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \frac{\diff Y}{\diff P_X} < 0 \]
  #+end_export


* Substitution and income effects


** Law of demand (I)

#+MATS: figcol fig-08_1004-eres20-*.pdf 0.55

- An increase in $P_X$, /ceteris paribus/, reduces the quantity
  demanded of $X$.


** Law of demand (and II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-08_1004-eres22-*.pdf 0.55

- The consumer analysis does not exclude the possibility that quantity
  demanded increases with own price.


** Giffen goods

- A *Giffen good* has a positively sloped demand curve.

- Under which conditions would we find a Giffen good?



** Effects of price change

- If the price of good $X$ increases:

  + The relative prices changes. The consumer tries to *substitute*
    the consumption of good $X$, which is now more expensive in
    relative terms, with the consumption of other goods.

  + The consumer has less consumption choices. His *real income*
    has decreased as a consequence of the price increase.


** Substitution effect and income effect

- The *total effect*, \ET, of a change in $P_X$ is the variation in
  the quantity demanded of good $X$.

- The *substitution effect*, \ES, is the part of the total effect that
  can be exclusively attributed to the change in the relative price.

- The *income effect*, \ER, is the part of the total effect that it is
  only due to the change in real income.

- $\ET = \ES + \ER$


** Decomposition of total effect (I)

- How can we determine which part of the total effect is due to the
  substitution effect and which part is due to the income effect?

- $X_H$: the quantity the consumer would demand if his real income had
  not changed and only the relative price had changed.

- We can obtain the substitution effect and the income effect by
  comparing $X_H$ with the demanded quantities before the increase of
  the price, $X_0$, and after the increase of the price, $X_1$.


** Decomposition of total effect (and II)

- From the initial quantity demanded, $X_0$; the final quantity
  demanded, $X_1$; and the quantity demanded if only the relative
  price had changed, $X_H$:
| Substitution effect: | $X_H - X_0$ | Only the relative price changes. |
| Income effect:       | $X_1 - X_H$ | Only the real income changes.    |
| Total effect:        | $X_1 - X_0$ | Both the relative price and the  |
|                      |             | real income change.              |


** Hicks decomposition

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hicks][Hicks]] identifies real income with utility level.

- When the relative price change but real income is constant, the new
  optimal choice must be on the same indifference curve than the
  initial choice.

- $X_H$: we look for a point on the initial indifference curve where
  the \RMS{} coincides with the final relative prices.


** Example (I)

- Utility function: $U(X, Y) = X^{2/3}Y^{1/3}$

- Monetary income: $M = \money{72}$

- Initial prices: $P_X = \price{2}$ y $P_Y = \price{1}$

- Final price of $X$: $P'_X = \price{16}$


** Example (II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-08_1004-eres02-*.pdf 0.55

- Total effect of the increase in $P_X$:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \ET = 3 - 24 = \units{-21} \]
  #+end_export


** Example (III)

#+MATS: figcol fig-08_1004-eres03-*.pdf 0.55

- $E_H$: choice if real income does not change.

- $E_H$ is on the same indifference curve as $E_0$.

- The \RMS{} at $E_H$ is equal to the final relative price: $P'_X/P_Y$.


** Example (and IV)

#+MATS: figcol fig-08_1004-eres04-*.pdf 0.55

- $\ES = 12 - 24 = \units{-12}$

- $\ER = 3 - 12 = \units{-9}$

- $\ET = \ES + \ER = \units{-21}$



** The sign of the substitution effect

- The *substitution effect* always has *negative sign*.

- The variation in quantity due to the substitution effect has the
  opposite sign than the variation in price.


** The sign of the income effect

- An increase of the price implies a decrease of real income.

- *Normal goods*: an increase of the price reduces demand as
  a consequence of the income effect. In this case, the *income
  effect* has *negative sign*.

- *inferior goods*: a higher price causes an increase in demand
  through the income effect. In this case the *income effect* has
  *positive sign*.


** Normal goods (I)

- The *total effect* of a *normal good* has *negative sign*:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \underset{(-)}{\ET} = \underset{(-)}{\ES}  +\underset{(-)}{\ER} \]
  #+end_export


** Normal goods (and II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-08_1004-eres10-*.pdf 0.55

- The substitution effect and the income effect reinforce each other.

- The slope of the demand curve is negative.


** Inferior goods (I)

- The *total effect* of an *inferior good* can have *negative or
  positive sign*:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \underset{(?)}{\ET} = \underset{(-)}{\ES}  + \underset{(+)}{\ER} \]
  #+end_export

- Often, the magnitude of the income effect is small compared to
  the substitution effect.
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ |\ER| < |\ES| \]
  #+end_export
- In this case, the slope of the demand curve is negative:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[
    \underset{(-)}{\ET} =
    \underset{(-)}{\ES}  + \underset{(+)}{\ER} \qquad
    \big(|\ER| < |\ES|\big)
  \]
  #+end_export


** Inferior goods (and II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-08_1004-eres11-*.pdf 0.55

- The income effect partially offsets the substitution effect.

- The slope of the demand curve is negative.


** Giffen goods (I)

- A Giffen good is an inferior good whose income effect is greater, in
  absolute terms, than the substitution effect:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[
    \underset{(+)}{\ET} =
    \underset{(-)}{\ES}  + \underset{(+)}{\ER} \qquad
    \big(|\ER| > |\ES|\big)
  \]
  #+end_export


** Giffen goods (II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-08_1004-eres12-*.pdf 0.55

- The income effect is higher in absolute terms than the substitution
  effect.

- The slope of the demand curve is positive.


** Giffen goods (and III)

- Under which conditions can we find a Giffen good?

  + Inferior good.

  + Small substitution effect.

  + Large income effect.



* Slutsky decomposition                                            :noexport:


** Slutsky decomposition (I)

- Slutsky identifies *real income* with *purchasing power*.
- The choice when just relative prices change must be on a budget line
  that allows you to buy the initial basket at final prices.


** Slutsky decomposition (II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-08_1004-eres05a-*.pdf 0.55

- $E_S$: choice if real income does not change.
- $E_S$ is on a budget line that goes through $E_0$.
- The slope of this budget line coincides with the final relative
  price: $P'_X/P_Y$.


** Slutsky decomposition (III)

#+MATS: figcol fig-08_1004-eres05-*.pdf 0.55

- $\ES = 17 - 24 = -7$.
- $\ER = 3 - 17 = -14$.
- $\ET = \ES + \ER= -21$.


** Slutsky decomposition (and IV)

#+MATS: figcol fig-08_1004-eres06-*.pdf 0.55

- The proposals of Hicks and Slutsky generate different results.
- Both coincide when the variation in prices is very small or in cases
  in which the \ER{} is equal to 0.
