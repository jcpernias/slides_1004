* Production


** Robinson Crusoeâ€™s economics
- Robinson has just reached an island, surviving in that way to the
  sinking of his boat.
- In his current state and with the little he has been able to rescue
  from the sinking he can only work 8 hours a day collecting coconuts
  or fishing.
- He dedicates the rest of the time to recover and to write a book.


** Production
- We can represent some of the options Robinson has by the following
  tables:

# #+MATS: fig unit02-tab-fpp1*.pdf


** Variables

#+MATS: col 0.57
- Coconut production:
  + $C$: kg of coconuts.
  + $L_C$: hours collecting coconuts.

#+MATS: col 0.43
- Fish production:
  + $\Fvar$: kg de fish.
  + $L_{\Fvar}$: hours fishing.



** Graphical representation

* The production possibilities frontier


** Production options
- Robinson can decide how to distribute the 8 hours of labor between
  the different activities.

# #+MATS: fig tab-t02-fpp2*.pdf


** The Production Possibilities Frontier (I)
#+figure: ./figures/fig-t02-fpp1.pdf 0.45

- The *production possibilities frontier* is the set of different
  production options where *all* the production factors are used.


** The Production Possibilities Frontier (II)
#+figure: ./figures/fig-t02-fpp2a.pdf 0.45

- Describes the options Robinson has, but does not tell us which one
  he will choose.


** The Production Possibilities Frontier (and III)
#+figure: ./figures/fig-t02-fpp1a.pdf 0.45

- The intersection points with the axes show the maximum production of
  each good.


** Feasible and infeasible options

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t02-fpp2.pdf 0.45

- $A$ and $B$ are *feasible options*.
- $I$ is an *inaccessible option*.


** Efficiency in production (I)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t02-fpp3a.pdf 0.45

- Option $A$ is feasible but inefficient: it is possible to increase
  fish production without reducing coconuts production.
- Ineficiency exits when there unemployed resources or their
  allocation is inadequate.


** Efficiency in production (and II)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t02-fpp3.pdf 0.45

- $B$ is an *efficient* production option. 
- *Efficiency*: it is not possible to produce more of a good without
  changing the production of the other good.


* The opportunity cost


** Opportunity cost (I)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t02-fpp4.pdf 0.45

- Starting from an efficient point, it is only possible to increase
  the production of a good giving up part of the production of other
  goods.


** Opportunity cost (II)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t02-fpp5.pdf 0.5

- $\Delta \Fvar = 2.2$ kg of fish.
- $\Delta C = -4.25$ kg of coconuts.


** Opportunity cost (III)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t02-fpp5.pdf 0.45

- Opportunity cost:
  \[ \left|\frac{\Delta C}{\Delta \Fvar}\right| = 1.93 \]
- Moving from $B$ to $D$ implies giving up $1.93$ kg of coconuts by
  each additional kg of fish.


** Opportunity cost (and IV)
- In our example the opportunity cost of producing one additional unit
  of fish is *increasing*.

** Slope and opportunity cost

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t02-fpp6.pdf 0.5

- The negative *slope* of the production possibilities frontier shows
  the opportunity cost of producing more fish.


** Concavity and increasing opportunity costs 

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t02-fpp7.pdf 0.5

- Production possibilities frontier *concavity* shows the *increasing*
  opportunity cost of producing more fish.


* Applications 


** Economic growth (I)

- With the production possibilities frontier we can describe the
  effects of *economic growth*.
- Economic growth may be due to a greater amount of production
  factors, factors quality improvements or technological improvements.


** Economic growth (II)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t02-gr2.pdf 0.45

- Economic growth makes the production possibilities frontier *shift*
  upwards and to the right.


** Economic growth (III)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t02-gr3.pdf 0.45

- A technological improvement in both sectors.

- As a consequence the production of all sectors can increase.


** Economic growth (and IV)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t02-gr1.pdf 0.45

- A technological improvement which affects *just* the fish
  production.

- Technical progress allows to obtain increases in the production of
  *all* the goods.
