* Consumer behavior


** Consumers

- Each *consumer* has a fixed amount of *monetary income*, $M$, that
  can be spent on the different good markets.

- A consumer can buy any number of units of a good at the prevailing
  market price.


** Simplifications

- Only two goods, $X$ and $Y$, with prices $P_X$ and $P_Y$.

- Perfect divisibility.

- Only one time period.


** Consumption bundles (I)

- A *consumption bundle* is a pair of numbers representing units of
  good $X$ and units of good $Y$.


** Consumption bundles (and II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-2A_1004-xy-*.pdf 0.4

- Bundle $A$: 1 unit of good $X$ and 3 units of good $Y$.

- Bundle $B$: 4 units of $X$ and 0 units of $Y$.


** Rational choice

- The *rational* consumer selects the best possible bundle he can
  afford.


* The budget constraint


** Consumer expenditures

- The *total expenditure* of buying
  $(X_0, Y_0)$ is $P_X X_0 + P_Y Y_0$ euros.

- $P_X X_0$ is the money spent on $X$.

- $P_Y Y_0$ is the money spent on $Y$.


** The budget set

- The *budget set* of a consumer comprises all the bundles he can
  afford:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ M \geq P_X X + P_Y Y \]
  #+end_export


** The budget line (I)

- The *budget line* is the set of bundles that exhaust the consumer's
  income:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ M = P_X X + P_Y Y \]
  #+end_export

- Another expression:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ Y = \frac{M}{P_Y} - \frac{P_X}{P_Y} X \]
  #+end_export


** The budget line (II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-2A_1004-rp1-*.pdf 0.4

- Intersection points: the maximum number of units the consumer can
  buy of each .


** The budget line (III)

#+MATS: figcol fig-2A_1004-rp3-*.pdf 0.4

- A bundle like $A$ is unaffordable.

- The consumer does not spend all his income if he purchases $B$.

- The consumer exhausts his income if he chooses $C$.

** The budget line (and IV)

#+MATS: figcol fig-2A_1004-rp4-*.pdf 0.4

- The slope of the budget line is the *relative price* with negative
  sign.



** The relative price

- The *relative price* of good $X$, $P_X/P_Y$, is the price of $X$ in
  units of good $Y$.



** The opportunity cost

- If the consumer spends all his income, the *opportunity cost* of
  consuming an additional unit of good $X$ are the units of good $Y$
  he has to give up.


** The relative price and the opportunity cost

#+MATS: figcol fig-2A_1004-rp5-*.pdf 0.4

- The opportunity cost coincides with the relative price:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \left|\frac{\Delta Y}{\Delta X}\right| = \frac{P_X}{P_Y} \]
  #+end_export



* Changes in prices and income


** Changes in a price (I)

#+MATS: figcol fig-2A_1004-rp6-*.pdf 0.4

- A reduction of the price of $X$:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ P'_X < P_X\]
  #+end_export



** Changes in a price (and II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-2A_1004-rp7-*.pdf 0.4

- An increase in the price of $Y$:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ P'_Y > P_Y \]
  #+end_export



** Changes in income

#+MATS: figcol fig-2A_1004-rp8-*.pdf 0.4

- An increase in income:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ M' > M \]
  #+end_export







* Extensions


** Composite goods

- Often we are only interested in one good: $X$.

- We use a *composite good* playing the role of good $Y$: the amount
  of money the consumer spends on other goods different from $X$.

- Given that $Y$ is measured in euros, $P_Y = 1$.

- Budget line:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ M = P_X X + Y \]
  #+end_export


** Non-linear budget constraints

- The budget constraint is linear if:

  1. the consumer can buy any amount of goods $X$ and $Y$ he can
     afford; and

  2. the prices, $P_X$ and $P_Y$, are independent of the quantities
     purchased by the consumer.

- If either of these two conditions is not fulfilled, the budget
  constraint is not linear.


** Rationing

#+MATS: figcol fig-2A_1004-rac1-*.pdf 0.45

- *Rationing*: The consumer cannot buy more than $\bar{X}$ units of
  good $X$.


** Subsidies

#+MATS: figcol fig-2A_1004-orp2-*.pdf 0.45

- The consumer get the first $\bar{X}$ units of $X$ at a reduced price
  $P'_X$.

- He pays the full price, $P_X > P'_X$, for additional units.


** Quantity discounts

#+MATS: figcol fig-2A_1004-orp4-*.pdf 0.45

- The first $\bar{X}$ units of $X$ are sold at the normal price $P_X$.

- Further units are sold at a lower price $P'_X < P_X$.



** Donations

#+MATS: figcol fig-2A_1004-orp3-*.pdf 0.45

- The consumer does not pay anything for the first $\bar{X}$ units of
  $X$.
