* Consumer’s Behavior


** Consumer
- *Consumer* has, in a given period of time, an
  *income* of $M$ euros.
- He can buy in the different markets of goods.
- For each unit purchased of a good, he always pays the same price.


** Simplifications
- Only two goods $X$ and $Y$, with prices $P_X$ and $P_Y$.
- Perfect divisibility.
- A unique period of time.


** Market basket (I)
- A *market basket* is a certain combination of units of good $X$ and units of good $Y$.
- It represents how many units of each good are consumed in a certain period of time.


** Market baskets (and II)
#+figure: ./figures/fig-t10-xy.pdf 0.45

- Market basket $A$ is composed by 1 unit of good $X$ and 3 units of
  good $Y$: $A = (1, 3)$.
- $B = (4, 0)$.


** Rational choice
- Between all disposable market baskets, a *rational* consumer chooses
  the one that generates greater well-being.




* The budget constraint


** Expenditure
- If a consumer chooses the market basket $(X_0, Y_0)$, his *total
  expenditure* is $P_X X_0 + P_Y Y_0$ euros.
- Expenditure in good $X$: $P_X X_0$ euros.
- Expenditure in good $Y$: $P_Y Y_0$ euros.


** Set of opportunities
- Consumer cannot borrow or lend.
- Total expenditure cannot be higher than income.
- Consumer can choose any basket of his *set of opportunities*:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ M \geq P_X X + P_Y Y \]
  #+end_export


** The budget constraint (I)
- The *budget constraints* are all the baskets which imply an
  expenditure exactly equal to consumer’s income:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ M = P_X X + P_Y Y \]
  #+end_export
- Another way of expressing it indicates the maximum consumption of Y
  when consumption of X takes a determined value:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ Y = \frac{M}{P_Y} - \frac{P_X}{P_Y} X \]
  #+end_export


** The budget constraint (and II)
#+figure: ./figures/fig-t10-rp1.pdf 0.5

- The intersection points with the axes are the *maximum consumptions*
  of each good: $M/P_X$ and $M/P_Y$.
- The slope of the Budget constraint is equal to the *relative price*
  with negative sign: $-P_X/P_Y$.


** Relative price
- The *relative price* is the Price of a good measured in units of
  another good.
- Indicates at which rate agood may be substituted for another in the
  market.
# - Example: Price of 1 kg of bread: $3$ €. Price of 1 l of water: $0.30$
#   €. Relative price: \[ \frac{P_P}{P_A} = \frac{3}{0.3} = 10\text{\ l
#   of wáter per kg of bread} \]


** Example (I)
- The set of opportunities when $M = 120$ €, $P_X = 6$ €/u. and $P_Y =
  3$ €/u. consists of all baskets that satisfy:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ 120 \geq 6 X + 3 Y \]
  #+end_export
- The budget constraint in this case is:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ 120 = 6 X + 3 Y \]
  #+end_export
- Another way of expressing it:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ Y = 40 - 2 X \]
  #+end_export


** Example (II)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t10-rp1b.pdf 0.45

- Maximum consumption of $X$: $20$ units.
- Maximum consumption of $Y$: $40$ units.
- Realtive price: $P_X/P_Y = 2$ units of $Y$ for each unit of $X$.


** Example (and III)
#+figure: ./figures/fig-t10-rp3.pdf 0.45

- Expenditure associated to the basket
  - $A$: $6\cdot 5 + 3 \cdot 35 = 135 € > M$
  - $B$: $6\cdot 12 + 3 \cdot 5 =  87 € < M$
  - $C$: $6\cdot 5 + 3 \cdot 30 = 120 € = M$


** Relative price and opportunity cost (I)
- If the consumer spends all his income, the *opportunity cost* of
  consuming an additional unit of good $X$ are the units of good $Y$
  he has to refuse to.


** Relative price and opportunity cost (and II)
#+figure: ./figures/fig-t10-rp5.pdf 0.45

- For each additional unit of $X$, consumer renounces 2
  units of $Y$:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[\left| \frac{\Delta Y}{\Delta X}\right| = \frac{20}{10} = 2  \]
  #+end_export
- Opportunity cost coincides with the relative price:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \left|\frac{\Delta Y}{\Delta X}\right| = \frac{P_X}{P_Y} = \frac{6}{3} = 2\]
  #+end_export


** Variations in a price (I)
#+figure: ./figures/fig-t10-rp6.pdf 0.45

- A decrease in the price of $X$:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ P'_X < P_X\]
  #+end_export
- The set of opppotunities expands.


** Variations in a price (and II)
#+figure: ./figures/fig-t10-rp7.pdf 0.45

- An increase in the Price of $Y$:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ P'_Y > P_Y \]
  #+end_export
- The set of opportunities shrinks.


** Variations in income

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t10-rp8.pdf 0.45

- An increase in income:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ M' > M \]
  #+end_export
- The slope of the constraint does not vary.
- The set of opportunities expands.



** Variations in prices and income (I)
#+figure: ./figures/fig-t10-rp10.pdf 0.45

- Reduction of $P_X$, $P'_X < P_X$, and decrease of $M$, $M' < M$.
- Some options are no longer available.
- But other options which were not available, now are possible.


** Variations in prices and income (and II)
#+figure: ./figures/fig-t10-rp11.pdf 0.45

- Changes in prices and income in the same proportion:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ P'_{X} = k P_{X}; P'_{Y} = k P_{Y};  M' = k M \]
  #+end_export
- The set of opportunities does not vary.




* Extensions


** Composite goods
- We focus on the consumption of a good: $X$.
- Good $Y$ is a *composite good*: $Y$ represents the amount of money
  the consumer spends on other goods.
- Given that $Y$ is measured in euros, $P_Y = 1$.
- Budget constraint:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ M = P_X X + Y \]
  #+end_export


** Other cases
- The Budget constraint is just a straight line in the case in which:
  1. the consumer can buy any amount of goods X and Y;
  2. prices, $P_X$ and $P_Y$, are independent of the quantities
     purchased by the consumer.
- If either of these two conditions is not fulfilled, the Budget
  constraint is not linear.


** Rationing

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t10-rac1.pdf 0.45

- *Rationing*: The consumption of good $X$ cannot be greater than $\bar{X}$, an amount established by the Government.


** Subsidies
#+figure: ./figures/fig-t10-orp2.pdf 0.45

- The first $\bar{X}$ units of $X$ are sold at a reduced price $P'_X$.
- Additional units are sold at their full price $P_X > P'_X$.


** Donations
#+figure: ./figures/fig-t10-orp3.pdf 0.45

- The consumer does not pay anything for the first $\bar{X}$ units of $X$.
