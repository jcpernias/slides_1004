* Nature and objectives of the firm


** Firms

- Why do firms exist?

- [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Coase][Ronald Coase]]: firms efficiently coordinate the production process by
  avoiding *transaction costs*: searching, bargaining, protecting
  trade secrets, monitoring, etc.


** Production

- *Technology* enables firms to combine *factors of production* to
  produce the *goods* that will then be sold in the *goods
  markets*.


** Factors of production

- Labor.

- Capital.


** Capital

- *Capital goods*: machinery, tools, buildings and structures used for
  the production process.

- Capital as a factor of production corresponds to the concept of
  *physical capital* and differs from *financial capital*: the
  amount of money needed to undertake or maintain a business.


** Technology

- *Technological restrictions*: only certain combinations of inputs are
  *feasible* ways to produce a given amount of output.

- The *production function* indicates the highest output level that a
  firm can produce for every specific combination of inputs.


** Temporal dimension of production

- The kind of the decisions that firm faces in the *short-run* are
  very different than those made in the *long-run*.


** The short-run

- In the short-run, the firm cannot change the quantities of one or
  more inputs: there are *fixed factors of production*.


** The long-run

- In the long-run, the firm can choose the quantities of all inputs: all
  the inputs are *variable factors*.


** Simplifications

- Firms only use labor, $L$, and capital, $K$.

- The production function relates output, $Q$, with the factors of
  production:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ Q = F(K, L) \]
  #+end_export

- Perfect divisibility of $K$, $L$, and $Q$.


* Production in the short-run


** Production with one variable factor

- In the short-run, capital is fixed: $K = \Kbar$.

- Short-run production function:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ Q = F(\Kbar, L) = f(L) \]
  #+end_export


** The total product curve

#+MATS: figcol fig-10_1004-cp01-*.pdf 0.45

- The *total product* curve relates output level and labor:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ Q = f(L) \]
  #+end_export


** The marginal product of labor

#+MATS: figcol fig-10_1004-cp03-*.pdf 0.45

- The *marginal product of labor* is the rate at which production
  increases per additional unit of labor:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \PMgL = \frac{\diff Q}{\diff L} = \frac{\diff f(L)}{\diff L} \]
  #+end_export


** The marginal product of labor curve

#+MATS: figcol fig-10_1004-cp06-*.pdf 0.45

- The marginal product curve has an inverted U-shape.


** The law of diminishing marginal returns

- *Law of diminishing marginal returns*: as additional
  units of an input are used, /holding all other inputs fixed/, a
  point will be reached at which the resulting additions to output
  decrease.


** Diminishing marginal returns to labaor

#+MATS: figcol fig-10_1004-cp06a-*.pdf 0.45

- The $\PMgL$ curve is increasing for low values of $L$.

- The $\PMgL$ is decreasing for values of $L$ higher than $L_C$.


** Technical efficiency (I)

#+MATS: figcol fig-10_1004-cp06b-*.pdf 0.45

- The $\PMgL$ is negative when $L > L_D$.

- If labor increases beyond $L_D$, total output decreases.


** Technical efficiency (and II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-10_1004-cp08-*.pdf 0.45

- Using more than $L_D$ units of labor is not technically efficient.

- The output level at $L_2$ is the same as the one at $L_1$.


** The average product of labor

#+MATS: figcol fig-10_1004-cp02-*.pdf 0.45

- The *average product of labor* is the amount of output per unit of
  labor:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \PMeL = \frac{Q}{L} = \frac{f(L)}{L}\]
  #+end_export


** The average product of labor curve

#+MATS: figcol fig-10_1004-cp07-*.pdf 0.45

- The average product of labor curve has an inverted U-shape.


** Total, average, and marginal product (I)

#+MATS: figcol fig-10_1004-cp05-*.pdf 0.45

- The $\PMeL$ curve:

  + increases if $\PMgL > \PMeL$.

  + decreases if $\PMgL < \PMeL$.

  + reaches its maximum when $\PMgL$ and $\PMeL$ are equal.


** Total, average, and marginal product (and II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-10_1004-cp04-*.pdf 0.45

- The total product curve attains a maximum at $L_D$, where $\PMgL =
  0$.

- The average product curve reaches its maximum at $L_E$, where
  $\PMgL$ and $\PMeL$ are equal.


* Production in the long-run


** Production with two variable factors

- In the long-run, all factors of production are variable.

- Long-run production function:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ Q = F(K, L) \]
  #+end_export


** Marginal product of the factors

- The *marginal product of labor* is the rate at which production
  grows per additional unit of labor:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \PMgL = \frac{\partial Q}{\partial L} = \frac{\partial F(K, L)}{\partial L}  \]
  #+end_export

- The *marginal product of capital* is the rate at which production
  grows per additional unit of capital:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \PMgK = \frac{\partial Q}{\partial K} = \frac{\partial F(K, L)}{\partial K}  \]
  #+end_export


** Isoquant

+ An *isoquant* is a set of all possible combinations of inputs that
  yield the same output level.



** Isoquant map

#+MATS: figcol fig-10_1004-is01-*.pdf 0.5

- Each isoquant corresponds to a different level of production.

- Higher isoquants represent greater output levels.


** The slope of the isoquants

- Totally differentiating the production function:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \diff Q = \PMgK \diff K + \PMgL \diff L \]
  #+end_export

- If we move along an isoquant, $\diff Q = 0$:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ 0 = \PMgK \diff K + \PMgL \diff L \]
  #+end_export

- Finally:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \left.\frac{\diff K}{\diff L}\right|_{\overline{Q}} = -\frac{\PMgL}{\PMgK} \]
  #+end_export


** The marginal rate of technical substitution (I)

- The *marginal rate of technical substitution*, $\RMST$, is the
  number of units of capital that can be substituted by an additional
  unit of labor, /keeping the production level constant/.


** The marginal rate of technical substitution (and II)

- It coincides with the slope of the isoquant with negative sign:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \RMST = -\left.\frac{\diff K}{\diff L}\right|_{\overline{Q}} \]
  #+end_export

- Therefore:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \RMST = \frac{\PMgL}{\PMgK} \]
  #+end_export


** Convexity

#+MATS: figcol fig-10_1004-is02-*.pdf 0.5

- We assume that isoquants are convex.

- Convexity implies a decreasing $\RMST$.


** Substitution among inputs

#+MATS: figcol fig-10_1004-is05-*.pdf 0.5

- The curvature of the isoquants indicates how easy it is to
  substitute one input for the other.


** Perfect substitutes

#+MATS: figcol fig-10_1004-is03-*.pdf 0.5

- The isoquants are straight lines when inputs are *perfect
  substitutes*.

- The $\RMST$ is constant at all points on an isoquant.

- Example: $Q = L + K$.


** Fixed-proportions production function

#+MATS: figcol fig-10_1004-is04-*.pdf 0.5

- *Fixed-proportions technology*: at the technically efficient points
  the factors are always combined in the same proportion.

- The $\RMST$ is not defined in the technically efficient combinations.

- Example: $Q = \min\{K, L\}$.



* Returns to scale


** Returns to scale

- *Returns to scale*: at which rate does the production grow when
  *all* inputs increase in proportion?


** Constant returns to scale (I)

- *Constant returns to scale*: the firm increase all inputs by a
  proportion $t$, $t > 1$, and the output level grows
  exactly in that proportion:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ F(t K, t L) = t F(K, L) \]
  #+end_export


** Constant returns to scale (and II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-10_1004-re01-*.pdf 0.5

- $B = 2 A$ y $Q_B = 2 Q_A$.

- $C = 3 A$ y $Q_C = 3 Q_A$.


** Increasing returns to scale (I)

- *Increasing returns to scale*: the firm increase all inputs by a
  proportion $t$, $t > 1$, and the output level grows more than
  proportionally:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ F(t K, t L) > t F(K, L) \]
  #+end_export


** Increasing returns to scale (and II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-10_1004-re02-*.pdf 0.5

- $B = 2 A$ y $Q_B > 2 Q_A$.

- $C = 3 A$ y $Q_C > 3 Q_A$.


** Decreasing returns to scale (I)

- *Decreasing returns to scale*: the firm increase all inputs by a
  proportion $t$, $t > 1$, and the output level grows less than
  proportionally:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ F(t K, t L) < t F(K, L) \]
  #+end_export


** Decreasing returns to scale (and II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-10_1004-re03-*.pdf 0.5

- $B = 2 A$ y $Q_B < 2 Q_A$.

- $C = 3 A$ y $Q_C < 3 Q_A$.


** Variable returns to scale

- Returns to scale need not be the same across all possible levels of
  production.
