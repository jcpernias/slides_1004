* Cost minimization in the long run

** The minimization of the production cost
- The firm chooses the combination of factors that minimizes the cost
  of producing a determined level of production, $\Qbar$:
  #+BEGIN_EXPORT LaTeX
    \begin{gather*}
      \min_{\{K^{*}, L^{*}\}} C = r K + w L \\
      \text{subject to\ } \Qbar = F(K, L)
    \end{gather*}
  #+END_EXPORT


** The isoquant

#+MATS: figcol fig-6B_1004-eq01-*.pdf 0.5

- The restriction the firm faces is the isoquant that corresponds to
  the production level $\Qbar$.
- The isoquant contains all the options the firm has to obtain $\Qbar$
  units of product.


** The isocost lines (I)
- An *isocost curve* is the set of all the combinations of factors
  that, at market prices, represent the same cost:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \Cbar = r K + w L \]
  #+end_export
- If the firm decisions cannot alter prices of the factors, the
  isocost is a straight line:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ K = \frac{\Cbar}{r} - \frac{w}{r} L \]
  #+end_export


** The isocost lines (II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-6B_1004-eq02-*.pdf 0.5

- The slope of the isocost line is negative:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[\left.\frac{\diff K}{\diff L}\right|_{\Cbar} = -\frac{w}{r} \]
  #+end_export
- To keep constant the production cost if the firm hires more units of
  $L$, it has to stop using some units of $K$.


** The isocost lines (and III)
- The slope of the isocost is equal to the relative price of factors
  with negative sign.

- The *relative price of factors*, $w/r$, is the number of units of
  $K$ that can be replaced per unit of $L$ without increasing the cost
  of production.


** The isocost map

#+MATS: figcol fig-6B_1004-eq03-*.pdf 0.5

- To each level of cost, $C_1, C_2, \dotsc$, it corresponds a
  different isocost.
- The more distant from the origin is the isocost, higher is the
  associated cost:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ C_1 < C_2 < C_3 < \dotsb \]
  #+end_export


** The optimal choice (I)

#+MATS: figcol fig-6B_1004-eq04-*.pdf 0.5

- The firm chooses the combination of factors that minimizes the cost
  of producing $\Qbar$ units.
- Combinations like $A$ or $B$, where an isocost line crosses the
  isoquant cannot be optimal.


** The optimal choice (II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-6B_1004-eq06-*.pdf 0.5

- In the combination $A$:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \RMST > \frac{w}{r} \]
  #+end_export
- The firm can produce $\Qbar$ at a lower cost if it replaces $K$ by
  $L$.


** The optimal choice (III)

#+MATS: figcol fig-6B_1004-eq07-*.pdf 0.5

- In the combination $B$:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \RMST < \frac{w}{r} \]
  #+end_export
- The firm can produce $\Qbar$ at a lower cost if it replaces $L$ by
  $K$.


** The optimal choice (and IV)

#+MATS: figcol fig-6B_1004-eq05-*.pdf 0.5

- Interior solution.
- Tangency condition:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \RMST = \frac{w}{r} \]
  #+end_export


** Duality(I)
- We have presented the problem of the choice of the optimal
  combination of factors as the one of the minimization of production
  costs.
- Alternatively we can present the problem of maximizing production
  given a determined production cost, $\Cbar$:
  #+BEGIN_EXPORT LaTeX
    \begin{gather*}
      \max_{\{K^{*}, L^{*}\}} Q = F(K, L)  \\
      \text{subject to\ } \Cbar = r K + w L
    \end{gather*}
  #+END_EXPORT


** Duality (and II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-6B_1004-eq08-*.pdf 0.5

- Interior solution.
- Tangency condition:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \RMST = \frac{w}{r} \]
  #+end_export



* Cost curves in the long run

** The expansion path of the product

#+MATS: figcol fig-6B_1004-exp02-*.pdf 0.5

- Given the prices of the factors, to each level of production
  corresponds a different optimal combination.
- The set of those optimal combinations is the *expansion path of the
  product*.


** Conditional demands of factors
- The *conditional demand of a factor* shows the optimal level of
  usage of that factor for each level of production:
  #+BEGIN_EXPORT LaTeX
    \begin{gather*}
      L = L(Q) \\
      K = K(Q)
    \end{gather*}
  #+END_EXPORT

- Using the conditional demands of factors, we obtain the
  *long-run cost curve*:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \CT_{\LP}(Q) = r K(Q) + w L(Q) \]
  #+end_export


** Long-run total cost curve

#+MATS: figcol fig-6B_1004-clp01-*.pdf 0.5

- In the long-run there are no fixed costs. The firm always has the
  option of not producing anything without costs:
  #+BEGIN_EXPORT LATEX
  \[ \CT_{\LP}(0) = 0 \]
  #+END_EXPORT


** Average cost and marginal cost(I)

- Long-run average cost:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \CMeLP(Q) = \frac{\CT_{\LP}(Q)}{Q} \]
  #+end_export
- Marginal cost in the long-run:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \CMgLP(Q) = \frac{\diff \CT_{\LP}(Q)}{\diff Q} \]
  #+end_export


** Average cost and marginal cost(II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-6B_1004-env08-*.pdf 0.53

- The curves cross at the minimum unit cost in the long-run.


** Average  cost and marginal cost(and III)
- The slope of the average cost depends on the relative position of
  the $\CMeLP$ and $\CMgLP$ curves:
  + $\CMeLP$ decreases when $\CMgLP < \CMeLP$.
  + $\CMeLP$ increases when $\CMgLP > \CMeLP$.
  + $\CMeLP$ reaches a minimum when $\CMgLP = \CMeLP$.


** Economies and diseconomies of scale (I)
- There exist *economies of scale* when costs increase in a lower
  proportion than production.
- When costs increase in a higher proportion than production there are
  *diseconomies of scale*.


** Economies and diseconomies of scale (and II)
- When there are economies of scale, the $\CMeLP$ decreases with
  production.
- When there are diseconomies of scale, the $\CMeLP$ increases with
  production.


** Returns to scale and costs in the long-run(I)
- If technology is characterized by constant returns to scale, then
  costs increase in the same proportion than production.
- For example, the firm can double its production by doubling the
  usage of all the factors of production:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ Q_1 = F(2 K_0, 2 L_0) = 2 F(K_0, L_0) = 2 Q_0 \]
  #+end_export
- In that case, costs also double:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \CT_{\LP}(Q_1) = r 2 K_0 + w 2 L_0 = 2 (r K_0 + w L_0) = 2 \CT_{\LP}(Q_0) \]
  #+end_export


** Returns to scale and costs in the long-run(II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-6B_1004-clp02-*.pdf 0.5

- With constant returns to scale, the cost function is linear in
  production:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \CT_{\LP}(Q) = c Q \]
  #+end_export


** Returns to scale and costs in the long-run(III)

#+MATS: figcol fig-6B_1004-clp03-*.pdf 0.5

- With constant returns to scale, the average cost and the marginal
  cost are equal to a same constant:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \CMeLP(Q) = \CMgLP(Q) = c \]
  #+end_export


** Returns to scale and costs in the long-run(and IV)
- With increasing returns to scale, when doubling the usage of factors
  production increases more than he double: there are *economies of
  scale*.
- With decreasing returns to scale, costs increase more quickly than
  production: there are *diseconomies of scale*.




* Relationship between short-run and long-run costs

** The short-run choice

#+MATS: figcol fig-6B_1004-exp03-*.pdf 0.5

- In the short-run the level of $K$ is fixed.
- Different levels of production can only be reached by altering the
  level of $L$.


** The short-run and the long-run choice

#+MATS: figcol fig-6B_1004-exp04-*.pdf 0.5

- In the long-run the firm can alter the usage of both factors.
- Just for a production level the short-run and the long-run decisions coincide, $C$.


** Short-run and long-run costs (I)

#+MATS: figcol fig-6B_1004-exp05-*.pdf 0.5

- Short-run costs are higher than long-run costs, except for a level of production.


** Short-run and long-run costs (II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-6B_1004-env20-*.pdf 0.5

- The long-run cost curve is below the short-run cost curves.
- Each short-run cost curve has a tangency point with the long-run
  cost curve.


** Short-run and long-run costs (and III)

#+MATS: figcol fig-6B_1004-env21-*.pdf 0.5

- Short-run average cost curves are above the long-run average cost
  curve and are tangent to $\CMeLP$ for a level of production.
- For that level of production the short-run marginal cost and the
  long-run marginal cost coincide.



* The envelope


** The choice of the plant size (I)

#+MATS: figcol fig-6B_1004-env01-*.pdf 0.55

- Let’s suppose the firm can only choose between two plant sizes:
  $K_1$ < $K_2$.
- Which would be its long-run decision?


** The choice of the plant size (and II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-6B_1004-env02-*.pdf 0.55

- If in the long-run it expects to produce less than $Q_A$, it is less
  costly to use the plant size $K_1$.
- The plant size $K_2$ is more efficient for production levels higher
  than $Q_A$.


** The envelope (I)

#+MATS: figcol fig-6B_1004-env03-*.pdf 0.55

- The long-run average cost curve is the *lower envelope* of the
  short-run curves.


** The envelope (II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-6B_1004-env04-*.pdf 0.55

- The long-run marginal cost curve is formed by the relevant sections
  of the short-run marginal cost curves.


** The envelope (III)

#+MATS: figcol fig-6B_1004-env05-*.pdf 0.55

- If the firm has more options, the long-run average cost curve is
  smoother.


** The envelope (and IV)

#+MATS: figcol fig-6B_1004-env06-*.pdf 0.55

- When the firm can choose between a continuous set of plant sizes,
  each short-run average cost curve is tangent to the $\CMeLP$ at a
  point.


** The efficient plant size

#+MATS: figcol fig-6B_1004-env07-*.pdf 0.55

- The *efficient plant size* corresponds to the minimum unit cost in
  the long-run.
- For the production level $Q_e$, $\CMeLP$, $\CMe_{e}$, $\CMgLP$ and
  $\CMg_{e}$ coincide.
