* Cost minimization in the long run


** The minimization of the production cost

- The firm chooses the combination of factors that minimizes the cost
  of producing a determined output level, $\Qbar$:
  #+BEGIN_EXPORT LaTeX
    \[
      \min_{\displaystyle\{K^{*}, L^{*}\}} C = r K + w L
      \stext{subject to\ } \Qbar = F(K, L)
    \]
  #+END_EXPORT


** The isoquant

#+MATS: figcol fig-6B_1004-eq01-*.pdf 0.45

- The firm chooses the less costly input combination on the isoquant $\Qbar$.


** Isocost lines (I)

- An *isocost line* contains all input combinations that represent the
  same cost level $\Cbar$:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \Cbar = r K + w L \]
  #+end_export

- Often, it is written as:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ K = \frac{\Cbar}{r} - \frac{w}{r} L \]
  #+end_export


** Isocost lines (and II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-6B_1004-eq02-*.pdf 0.45

- The slope of the isocost line is equal to the relative price of
  factors with negative sign:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[\left.\frac{\diff K}{\diff L}\right|_{\Cbar} = -\frac{w}{r} \]
  #+end_export


** The relative input price

- The *relative price of factors*, $w/r$, is the number of units of
  $K$ that can be replaced per unit of $L$ keeping costs constant.


** The isocost lines map

#+MATS: figcol fig-6B_1004-eq03-*.pdf 0.45

- Each isocost line corresponds to a different cost level.

- The higher the isocost line, the greater the cost.


** The optimal choice (I)

#+MATS: figcol fig-6B_1004-eq04-*.pdf 0.45

- The firm chooses the combination of factors of production that
  minimizes the cost of producing $\Qbar$ units.

- Combinations like $A$ or $B$ cannot be optimal.


** The optimal choice (II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-6B_1004-eq06-*.pdf 0.45

- In the combination $A$:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \RMST > \frac{w}{r} \]
  #+end_export
- The firm can produce $\Qbar$ at a lower cost if it replaces $K$ by
  $L$.


** The optimal choice (III)

#+MATS: figcol fig-6B_1004-eq07-*.pdf 0.45

- In the combination $B$:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \RMST < \frac{w}{r} \]
  #+end_export
- The firm can produce $\Qbar$ at a lower cost if it replaces $L$ by
  $K$.


** The optimal choice (and IV)

#+MATS: figcol fig-6B_1004-eq05-*.pdf 0.45

- Isoquant:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \Qbar = F(K, L) \]
  #+end_export

- Tangency condition:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \RMST = \frac{w}{r} \]
  #+end_export


** Duality(I)
- *Dual program*: maximize production for a given cost of production,
  $\Cbar$:
  #+begin_export latex
    \[
      \max_{\displaystyle\{K^{*}, L^{*}\}} Q = F(K, L)
      \stext{subject to\ } \Cbar = r K + w L
    \]
  #+end_export


** Duality (and II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-6B_1004-eq08-*.pdf 0.45

- Isocost line:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \Cbar = r K + w L \]
  #+end_export


- Tangency condition:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \RMST = \frac{w}{r} \]
  #+end_export

#+MATS: pagebreak


* Cost curves in the long run


** Product expansion path

#+MATS: figcol fig-6B_1004-exp02-*.pdf 0.5

- Given the input prices, there is a different optimal combination for
  each output level: the *product expansion path*.


** Conditional demand of an input

- The *conditional demand of an input* shows the optimal quantity of
  that input for each level of production: $L = L(Q)$ and $K = K(Q)$.



** The long-run total cost curve

#+MATS: figcol fig-6B_1004-clp01-*.pdf 0.47

- The *long-run total cost curve*:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \CT_{\LP}(Q) = r K(Q) + w L(Q) \]
  #+end_export


** Average cost and marginal cost (I)

- Long-run average cost:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \CMeLP(Q) = \frac{\CT_{\LP}(Q)}{Q} \]
  #+end_export

- Long-run marginal cost:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \CMgLP(Q) = \frac{\diff \CT_{\LP}(Q)}{\diff Q} \]
  #+end_export


** Average cost and marginal cost (and II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-6B_1004-env08-*.pdf 0.45

- The $\CMeLP$ curve:

  + decreases if $\CMgLP < \CMeLP$.

  + increases if $\CMgLP > \CMeLP$.

  + reaches a minimum when $\CMgLP = \CMeLP$.



** Economies and diseconomies of scale (I)

- There exist *economies of scale* when total cost increase less than
  proportionally to production.

- There exist *diseconomies of scale* when total cost grows faster
  than output.


** Economies and diseconomies of scale (and II)

- When there are economies of scale, the $\CMeLP$ is decreasing.

- When there are diseconomies of scale, the $\CMeLP$ is increasing.


** Returns to scale and costs in the long-run (I)

- Total costs increase in the same proportion than production when
  there are constant returns to scale.


** Returns to scale and costs in the long-run (II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-6B_1004-clp02-*.pdf 0.45

- The cost function is linear when there are constant returns to
  scale:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \CT_{\LP}(Q) = c Q \]
  #+end_export


** Returns to scale and costs in the long-run (III)

#+MATS: figcol fig-6B_1004-clp03-*.pdf 0.45

- The average and the marginal costs are both equal to the same
  constant when there are constant returns to scale:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \CMeLP(Q) = \CMgLP(Q) = c \]
  #+end_export


** Returns to scale and costs in the long-run (and IV)

- If there are increasing returns to scale, output grows faster than
  costs: there are *economies of scale*.

- If there are decreasing returns to scale, output grows slower than
  costs: there are *diseconomies of scale*.




* Relationship between short-run and long-run costs


** The short-run choice

#+MATS: figcol fig-6B_1004-exp03-*.pdf 0.45

- In the short-run, the level of $K$ is fixed and different output
  levels can only be reached by altering the level of $L$.


** The short-run and the long-run choices

#+MATS: figcol fig-6B_1004-exp04-*.pdf 0.45

- In the long-run, the firm can change all inputs.

- Only at one output level the long-run choice is the same as the
  short-run one.


** Short-run and long-run costs (I)

#+MATS: figcol fig-6B_1004-exp05-*.pdf 0.45

- Short-run costs are higher than long-run costs, except for one level
  of production.


** Short-run and long-run costs (II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-6B_1004-env20-*.pdf 0.45

- The long-run cost curve is below the short-run cost curves.

- Each short-run cost curve is tangent to the long-run cost curve at
  one point.


** Short-run and long-run costs (and III)

#+MATS: figcol fig-6B_1004-env21-*.pdf 0.45

- Each short-run average cost curve is above the long-run average cost
  curve and is tangent to $\CMeLP$ at one output level.

** The choice of the plant size (I)

#+MATS: figcol fig-6B_1004-env01-*.pdf 0.55

- Consider first the case in which the firm can only choose between
  two plant sizes: $K_1$ < $K_2$. Which would be its long-run
  decision?


** The choice of the plant size (and II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-6B_1004-env02-*.pdf 0.55

- If the firm expects to produce less than $Q_A$ in the long-run, the
  plant size $K_1$ has lower costs.

- The plant size $K_2$ is more efficient for output levels higher than
  $Q_A$.


** The envelope (I)

#+MATS: figcol fig-6B_1004-env03-*.pdf 0.55

- The long-run average cost curve is the *lower envelope* of the
  short-run curves.


** The envelope (II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-6B_1004-env05-*.pdf 0.55

- If the firm can choose among more plant sizes, the long-run average
  cost curve is smoother.

#+MATS: pagebreak


** The envelope (and III)

#+MATS: figcol fig-6B_1004-env06-*.pdf 0.55

- When the firm can choose among a continuum of plant sizes, each
  short-run average cost curve is tangent to the $\CMeLP$ at one
  point.


** The efficient plant size

#+MATS: figcol fig-6B_1004-env07-*.pdf 0.55

- The *efficient plant size* corresponds to the minimum long-run unit
  cost.

- At that production level, $Q_e$, $\CMeLP$, $\CMe_{e}$, $\CMgLP$ and
  $\CMg_{e}$ coincide.
