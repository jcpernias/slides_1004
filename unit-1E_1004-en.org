* Controls on prices


** Price regulation
- Government legally establishes limits to the prices of some specific
  goods.
- Government considers that market price harms buyers or sellers.
- Which are the consequences of price controls in a *competitive market*?


** Price ceilings (I)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t05-pmax1.pdf 0.48

- Government tries to reduce the price for buyers.
- By establishing a *maximum price* prices over a determined value are
  banned. So that, 
  \[ P \leq \Pmax \]


** Price ceilings (II)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t05-pmax2.pdf 0.48

- If the maximum price is above the equilibrium price, the regulation has no effect.


** Price ceilings (and III)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t05-pmax3.pdf 0.48

- When the maximum price is below the equilibrium price there is a shortage in the market.
- Buyers pay a lower price for the good.
- But production is not enough to satisfy demand.


** Price floors (I)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t05-pmin1.pdf 0.48

- Government tries to raise the price sellers receive.
- By establishing a *minimum price* prices below a determined value are
  banned. So that,
  \[ P \geq \Pmin \]


** Price floors (II)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t05-pmin2.pdf 0.48

- If the minimum price is below the equilibrium price, the regulation has
  no effect.


** Price floors (and III)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t05-pmin3.pdf 0.48

- When the minimum price is over the equilibrium price there is a surplus
  in the market.
- Sellers receive a higher price for the good.
- But many sellers do not find people to buy their production.


** Effects of price controls
- In a *competitive market* price controls tend to harm those sectors
  who were supposed to be helped.
- Other type of regulations can achieve the expected purpose without
  distorting the markets functioning.
- In *non-competitive markets* price controls can be effective.


* Taxes


** A tax on sales
- The government establishes a tax of $t$ euros per unit sold.
- How does this tax affect a *competitive market*?
- How is the burden of the tax distributed between buyers and sellers?


** A tax on sellers (I)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t05-st1.pdf 0.45

 - The tax is collected by sellers.
 - Sellers have to pay for the production costs as well as to the
   government the amount of $t$ euros per unit sold.
 - Supply decreases.


** A tax on sellers (II)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t05-st2.pdf 0.48
 
- In the new equilibrium the quantity sold is lower.
- Price increases, but *less than the tax*.


** A tax on sellers (and III)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t05-st3.pdf 0.48
 
- The tax burden is distributed between buyers and sellers.
- Buyers pay a higher price.
- Sellers receive a lower amount per unit, $P_1 - t$.


** A tax on buyers (I)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t05-bt1.pdf 0.45

- The tax is collected by buyers.
- Buyers have to pay the price as well as the tax of
  $t$ euros per unit bought.
- Demand decreases.


** A tax on buyers (II)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t05-bt2.pdf 0.45

- In the new equilibrium a lower quantity is sold.
- The price that sellers receive decreases, but *less than the tax*.


** A tax on buyers (and III)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t05-bt3.pdf 0.48

- The tax burden is distributed between buyers and sellers.
- Buyers pay a higher price per unit, $P_1 + t$.
- Sellers receive a lower price.


** Incidence of taxes (I)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t05-inc1.pdf 0.45
- The tax incidence is *independent of who collects the tax*.
- The distribution of the tax burden between buyers and sellers
  depends on the elasticities of demand and supply.


** Incidence of taxes (II)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t05-inc2.pdf 0.45

- If supply is relatively more inelastic than demand, producers
  support most of the tax burden.


** Impact of taxes (and III)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t05-inc3.pdf 0.45

- If demand is relatively more inelastic than supply, consumers
  support most of the tax burden.


** Taxes effects
 - By introducing a tax on sales in a *competitive market*:
   + The quantity that is sold decreases.
   + The tax burden is distributed between buyers and sellers.
   + The tax burden falls more heavily on the less elastic side
     of the market.
