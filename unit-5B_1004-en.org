* Production in the long-run


** Production with two variable factors

- In the long-run, all factors of production are variable.

- Long-run production function:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ Q = F(K, L) \]
  #+end_export


** Marginal product of the factors

- The *marginal product of labor* is the rate at which production
  grows per additional unit of labor:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \PMgL = \frac{\partial Q}{\partial L} = \frac{\partial F(K, L)}{\partial L}  \]
  #+end_export

- The *marginal product of capital* is the rate at which production
  grows per additional unit of capital:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \PMgK = \frac{\partial Q}{\partial K} = \frac{\partial F(K, L)}{\partial K}  \]
  #+end_export


** Isoquant

+ An *isoquant* is a set of all possible combinations of inputs that
  yield the same output level.



** Isoquant map

#+MATS: figcol fig-5B_1004-is01-*.pdf 0.5

- Each isoquant corresponds to a different level of production.

- Higher isoquants represent greater output levels.


** The slope of the isoquants

- Totally differentiating the production function:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \diff Q = \PMgK \diff K + \PMgL \diff L \]
  #+end_export

- If we move along an isoquant, $\diff Q = 0$:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ 0 = \PMgK \diff K + \PMgL \diff L \]
  #+end_export

- Finally:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \left.\frac{\diff K}{\diff L}\right|_{\overline{Q}} = -\frac{\PMgL}{\PMgK} \]
  #+end_export


** The marginal rate of technical substitution (I)

- The *marginal rate of technical substitution*, $\RMST$, is the
  number of units of capital that can be substituted by an additional
  unit of labor, /keeping the production level constant/.


** The marginal rate of technical substitution (and II)

- It coincides with the slope of the isoquant with negative sign:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \RMST = -\left.\frac{\diff K}{\diff L}\right|_{\overline{Q}} \]
  #+end_export

- Therefore:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \RMST = \frac{\PMgL}{\PMgK} \]
  #+end_export


** Convexity

#+MATS: figcol fig-5B_1004-is02-*.pdf 0.5

- We assume that isoquants are convex.

- Convexity implies a decreasing $\RMST$.


** Substitution among inputs

#+MATS: figcol fig-5B_1004-is05-*.pdf 0.5

- The curvature of the isoquants indicates how easy it is to
  substitute one input for the other.


** Perfect substitutes

#+MATS: figcol fig-5B_1004-is03-*.pdf 0.5

- The isoquants are straight lines when inputs are *perfect
  substitutes*.

- The $\RMST$ is constant at all points on an isoquant.

- Example: $Q = L + K$.


** Fixed-proportions production function

#+MATS: figcol fig-5B_1004-is04-*.pdf 0.5

- *Fixed-proportions technology*: at the technically efficient points
  the factors are always combined in the same proportion.

- The $\RMST$ is not defined in the technically efficient combinations.

- Example: $Q = \min\{K, L\}$.



* Returns to scale


** Returns to scale

- *Returns to scale*: at which rate does the production grow when
  *all* inputs increase in proportion?


** Constant returns to scale (I)

- *Constant returns to scale*: the firm increase all inputs by a
  proportion $t$, $t > 1$, and the output level grows
  exactly in that proportion:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ F(t K, t L) = t F(K, L) \]
  #+end_export


** Constant returns to scale (and II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-5B_1004-re01-*.pdf 0.5

- $B = 2 A$ y $Q_B = 2 Q_A$.

- $C = 3 A$ y $Q_C = 3 Q_A$.


** Increasing returns to scale (I)

- *Increasing returns to scale*: the firm increase all inputs by a
  proportion $t$, $t > 1$, and the output level grows more than
  proportionally:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ F(t K, t L) > t F(K, L) \]
  #+end_export


** Increasing returns to scale (and II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-5B_1004-re02-*.pdf 0.5

- $B = 2 A$ y $Q_B > 2 Q_A$.

- $C = 3 A$ y $Q_C > 3 Q_A$.


** Decreasing returns to scale (I)

- *Decreasing returns to scale*: the firm increase all inputs by a
  proportion $t$, $t > 1$, and the output level grows less than
  proportionally:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ F(t K, t L) < t F(K, L) \]
  #+end_export


** Decreasing returns to scale (and II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-5B_1004-re03-*.pdf 0.5

- $B = 2 A$ y $Q_B < 2 Q_A$.

- $C = 3 A$ y $Q_C < 3 Q_A$.


** Variable returns to scale

- Returns to scale need not be the same across all possible levels of
  production.
