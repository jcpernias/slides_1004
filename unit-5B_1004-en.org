* Long term production

** Production with two variable factors
- In the long term all factors are variable.
- Long term production function:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ Q = F(K, L) \]
  #+end_export


** Marginal product of the factors

- The *marginal product of labour* is the rate at which production
  grows per additional unit of labour:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \PMgL = \frac{\partial Q}{\partial L} = \frac{\partial F(K, L)}{\partial L}  \]
  #+end_export
- The *marginal product of capital* is the rate at which production
  grows per additional unit of capital:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \PMgK = \frac{\partial Q}{\partial K} = \frac{\partial F(K, L)}{\partial K}  \]
  #+end_export


** Isoquant
- The *isoquant* is the set of combinations of factors with which it
  can be obtained the same maximum level of production.



** Isoquant map

#+MATS: figcol fig-5B_1004-is01-*.pdf 0.5

- A different isoquant corresponds to each level of production .
- The more distant from the origin isoquants are associated with
  higher production levels.


** The slope of the isoquants (I)
- Total differential of the production function:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \diff Q = \PMgK \diff K + \PMgL \diff L \]
  #+end_export
- If we move along an isoquant, $\diff Q = 0$. Then:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ 0 = \PMgK \diff K + \PMgL \diff L \]
  #+end_export
- Operating:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \left.\frac{\diff K}{\diff L}\right|_{\overline{Q}} = -\frac{\PMgL}{\PMgK} \]
  #+end_export


** The slope of the isoquants (and II)
- If a combinations of factors is technically efficient to obtain a determined level of production it should meet that: $\PMgL > 0$ and $\PMgK > 0$.

- Isoquants have a negative slope in the technically efficient combinations.
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \left.\frac{\diff K}{\diff L}\right|_{\overline{Q}} = -\frac{\PMgL}{\PMgK} < 0\]
  #+end_export


** Marginal rate of technical substitution
- The *marginal rate of technical substitution*, $\RMST$, is the number of units of capital that can be substituted by a unit of labour, keeping the production level constant.
- It coincides with the slope of the isoquant with negative sign:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \RMST = -\left.\frac{\diff K}{\diff L}\right|_{\overline{Q}} \]
  #+end_export
- Therefore:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \RMST = \frac{\PMgL}{\PMgK} \]
  #+end_export


** Convexity

#+MATS: figcol fig-5B_1004-is02-*.pdf 0.5

- We assume that the isoquants are convex.
- Convexity implies the $\RMST$ is decreasing.


** Convexity and returns of a factor
- *Convexity and diminishing returns of a factor* are two different
  properties: one does not imply the other.
- The law of diminishing returns of a factor can be fulfilled without
  the $\RMST$ being decreasing:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ Q = \big(K + L\big)^{1/2} \]
  #+end_export
- The $\RMST$ may be decreasing but the law of diminishing returns of
  a factor may not be fulfilled:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ Q = K L \]
  #+end_export


** Substitutability

#+MATS: figcol fig-5B_1004-is05-*.pdf 0.5

- The curvature of the isoquants indicates the degree of substitutability of a factor for other when obtaining a certain level of production.


** Perfectly substitutable factors

#+MATS: figcol fig-5B_1004-is03-*.pdf 0.5

- *Perfect substitutability of factors*: the factors can be
  substituted always at the same rate.
- The $\RMST$ always takes the same value.
- Example:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ Q = L + K \]
  #+end_export


** Fixed-proportions production function

#+MATS: figcol fig-5B_1004-is04-*.pdf 0.5

- *Fixed-proportions technology*: at the technically efficient points
  the factors are always combined in the same proportion.

- The $\RMST$ is not defined in the technically efficient combinations.

- Example:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ Q = \min\{K, L\} \]
  #+end_export



* Returns to scale

** Returns to scale (I)
- *Returns to scale*: at which rate does the production grow when the
  usage of *all* factors is increased by the same proportion?


** Returns to scale (and II)
- For example, we start from a determined combination of factors:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ Q_0 = F(4, 3) = 10 \]
  #+end_export
- We triple the usage of factors and obtain a new level of production:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ Q_1 = F(12, 9) = 30 \]
  #+end_export
- In our example, production has increased by the same proportion as the factors: $Q_1 = 3 Q_0$. That is:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[   F(3 \cdot 4, 3 \cdot 3) = 3 F(4, 3) \]
  #+end_export


** Constant returns to scale (I)
- In general, there are *constant returns to scale* if when increasing
  the usage of the factors by a proportion $\lambda$, $\lambda > 1$,
  the level of production varies exactly in that same proportion:
  #
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ F(\lambda K, \lambda L) = \lambda F(K, L) \]
  #+end_export


** Constant returns to scale (and II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-5B_1004-re01-*.pdf 0.5

- $B = 2 A$ y $Q_B = 2 Q_A$.
- $C = 3 A$ y $Q_C = 3 Q_A$.


** Increasing returns to scale (I)
- There are *increasing returns to scale* is when increasing the usage
  of the factors by a proportion $\lambda$, $\lambda > 1$, the level
  of production increases more than proportionally:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ F(\lambda K, \lambda L) > \lambda F(K, L) \]
  #+end_export


** Increasing returns to scale (and II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-5B_1004-re02-*.pdf 0.5

- $B = 2 A$ y $Q_B > 2 Q_A$.
- $C = 3 A$ y $Q_C > 3 Q_A$.


** Decreasing returns to scale (I)
- There are *decreasing returns to scale* if when increasing the usage
  of the factors by a proportion $\lambda$, $\lambda > 1$,the
  proportion at which the level of production increases is lower than
  $\lambda$:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ F(\lambda K, \lambda L) < \lambda F(K, L) \]
  #+end_export


** Decreasing returns to scale (and II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-5B_1004-re03-*.pdf 0.5

- $B = 2 A$ y $Q_B < 2 Q_A$.
- $C = 3 A$ y $Q_B < 3 Q_A$.


** Variable returns to scale
- The same technology can have different types of returns to scale
  depending on the production level in which the firm operates.


** Returns to scale and factor returns
- They are independent concepts: the type of returns to scale does not
  imply (nor is deduced from) the fulfilment of the law of diminishing
  returns of a factor
