* Costs in the short run


** Profit maximization

- A *rational* firm makes its decisions with the goal of *maximizing
  its profits*.

- We decompose the problem of maximizing profits in two parts:

  + How to minimize the production costs

  + How much to produce


** The firm’s behaviour

- The firm can use any amount of inputs at their market prices:

  + $w$ is the wage;

  + $r$ is the price of capital.

- The firm by itself cannot affect the input prices.


** Total cost

- *Total cost*: the value of the remuneration of the factors at their
  market prices.

- Although some of the factors are owned by the firm, we must include
  the *opportunity cost*.

- The total cost is:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ C = r K + w L \]
  #+end_export


** The short-run

- In the short run:

  + The capital is fixed: $K = \Kbar$.

  + The firm can only alter its output level by varying its labor
    input.


** Fixed and variable costs

- *Fixed cost*: are those associated to the use of fixed factors:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \CF = r \Kbar \]
  #+end_export

- *Variable cost*: are the remuneration of variable factors:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \CV = w L \]
  #+end_export


** Total cost in the short run

- The *total cost in the short run*:
  #+Begin_export latex
  \[ C = \CF + \CV \]
  #+end_export

- It is the sum of fixed and variable costs:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ C = r \Kbar + w L \]
  #+end_export


* Costs curves in the short run


** Costs and production (I)

#+MATS: figcol fig-6A_1004-sr01-*.pdf 0.55

- The total product function relates the firm's output level and labor:
    #+begin_export latex
  \[ Q = f(L) \]
  #+end_export


** Costs and production (and II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-6A_1004-sr02-*.pdf 0.55

- The inverse of the total product function shows the amount of labor
  requires to reach a given level of production:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ L = f^{-1}(Q) \]
  #+end_export


** The variable cost curve

#+MATS: figcol fig-6A_1004-sr03-*.pdf 0.55

- The *variable cost curve* indicates the minimum variable cost at
  which a determined level of production can be obtained:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \CV(Q) = w f^{-1}(Q) \]
  #+end_export


** Total cost curve

#+MATS: figcol fig-6A_1004-sr04-*.pdf 0.55

- The fixed cost does not depend on the production level.

- The *total cost curve* is obtained by adding the fixed and the
  variable cost for each level of production.


** The cost curves in the short term

- The fixed cost does not depend on the production level:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \CF(Q) = r \Kbar \]
  #+end_export

- The variable cost is obtained by inverting the total product
  function in the short term:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \CV(Q) = w f^{-1}(Q) \]
  #+end_export

- Total cost is the sum of fixed and variable cost:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \CT(Q) = r \Kbar + w f^{-1}(Q) \]
  #+end_export


** The marginal cost curve

- The *marginal cost* is the rate at which total cost varies per
  additional unit of production:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \CMg = \frac{\diff C}{\diff Q} \]
  #+end_export

- The marginal cost is the derivative of variable cost with respect to
  $Q$:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \CMg = \frac{\diff \CF}{\diff Q} + \frac{\diff \CV}{\diff Q} = \frac{\diff \CV}{\diff Q} \]
  #+end_export


** Average cost curves

- *Average fixed cost*:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \CFMe = \frac{\CF}{Q} \]
  #+end_export

- *Average variable cost*:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \CFMe = \frac{\CF}{Q} \qquad \CVMe = \frac{\CV}{Q} \]
  #+end_export

- *Average cost*:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \CMe = \frac{C}{Q} = \CFMe + \CVMe \]
  #+end_export


** Relationship between $\PMg$, $\PMe$, $\CMg$ and $\CMe$  (I)

- The variable cost is:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \CV = w L \]
  #+end_export

- Dividing by the level of production, we get the average variable
  cost:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \CVMe = w \frac{L}{Q} = w\frac{1}{Q/L} = \frac{w}{\PMeL} \]
  #+end_export

- On the other hand, the rate at which the $\CV$ changes per
  additional unit of $Q$ is the marginal cost:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \CMg = \frac{\diff \CV}{\diff Q} = w \frac{\diff L}{\diff Q} = w\frac{1}{\diff Q/\diff L} = \frac{w}{\PMgL} \]
  #+end_export


** Relationship between $\PMg$, $\PMe$, $\CMg$ and $\CMe$  (II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-6A_1004-sr05-*.pdf 0.55

- The shape of the average and marginal product curves determine the
  shape of the average and marginal cost curves.

- $\PMgL$ and $\PMeL$ have a shape of an inverted U.


** Relationship between $\PMg$, $\PMe$, $\CMg$ and $\CMe$  (and III)

#+MATS: figcol fig-6A_1004-sr06-*.pdf 0.55

- The average and marginal cost curves are U-shaped.

- The $\CMg$ curve crosses the $\CVMe$ curve at the minimum of the
  average variable costs.


** Average variable cost and marginal cost curves

#+MATS: figcol fig-6A_1004-sr06-*.pdf 0.55

- When $\CMg < \CVMe$, the average variable cost decrease with $Q$.

- The average variable cost increases with production when $\CMg >
  \CVMe$.


** The average fixed cost curve

#+MATS: figcol fig-6A_1004-sr07-*.pdf 0.55

- The *average fixed cost curve* decreases as production increases:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \CFMe(Q) = \frac{r \Kbar}{Q} \]
  #+end_export


** Average cost curve (I)

#+MATS: figcol fig-6A_1004-sr08-*.pdf 0.55

- The $\CMe$ curve is the sum of the $\CVMe$ and the $\CFMe$ for each
  level of production.

- The $\CMg$ curve crosses the $\CMe$ curve at the minimum average cost.


** The average cost curve (and II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-6A_1004-sr08-*.pdf 0.55

- The $\CMe$ curve decreases with $Q$ when $\CMg < \CMe$.

- The $\CMe$ curve is increasing when $\CMg > \CMe$.
