* Costs in the short run

** Maximization of profits
- A *rational* firm makes its decisions with the goal of *maximizing its profits*.
- We decompose the problem of maximizing profits in two parts:
  + How to minimize the production costs
  + How much to produce


** The firm’s behaviour
- The firm can purchase at the market price the desired amount of a factor.
- The firm by itself cannot alter the prices it pays for the factors.


** Total cost
- *Total cost*: value of the remuneration of the factors at their market prices.
- Although some of the factors are owned by the firm, we must include
  the *opportunity cost*.
- The total cost is:
  \[ C = r K + w L \]
  where $w$ is the wage and $r$ the price of capital.


** Total cost in the short run
- In the short run capital is a fixed factor: $K = \Kbar$.
- Total costs in the short run:
  \[ C = r \Kbar + w L \]


** Fixed and variable costs
- The *fixed costs* are those associated to the use of fixed factors:
  \[ \CF = r \Kbar \]
- The *variable costs* are the remuneration of variable factors:
  \[ \CV = w L \]
- The *total cost in the short run* is the sum of the fixed cost and
  the variable cost:
  \[ C = \CF + \CV \]



* Costs curves in the short run

** Costs and production (I)
- In the short run the firm can only vary its level of production by
  varying the usage of labour.
- Changes in the production level cause changes in the variable costs.
- The fixed costs are independent of the production level:
  \[ \frac{\diff \CF}{\diff Q} = 0 \]


** Costs and production (II)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t30-sr01.pdf 0.55

- The total product function shows the production the firm obtains by
  using a determined level of labour.
- In the short run, $Q$ can only be changed by varying $L$.


** Costs and production (and III)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t30-sr02.pdf 0.55

- The inverse of the total product function shows the needed labour to
  reach a determined level of production.


** The variable cost curve

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t30-sr03.pdf 0.55

- The *variable cost curve* indicates the minimum variable cost at
  which a determined level of production can be obtained:
  \[ \CV(Q) = w f^{-1}(Q) \]


** Total cost curve

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t30-sr04.pdf 0.55

- The fixed cost does not depend on the production level.
- The *total cost curve* is obtained by adding the fixed and the
  variable cost for each level of production.


** The cost curves in the short term
- The fixed cost does not depend on the production level:
  \[ \CF(Q) = r \Kbar \]
- The variable cost is obtained by inverting the total product
  function in the short term:
  \[ \CV(Q) = w f^{-1}(Q) \]
- Total cost is the sum of fixed and variable cost:
  \[ \CT(Q) = r \Kbar + w f^{-1}(Q) \]


** Marginal cost
- The *marginal cost* is the rate at which total cost varies per
  additional unit of production:
  \[ \CMg = \frac{\diff C}{\diff Q} \]
- The marginal cost can be expressed as the derivative of variable
  cost with respect to $Q$:
  \[ \CMg =
     \frac{\diff \CF}{\diff Q} + \frac{\diff \CV}{\diff Q} =
     \frac{\diff \CV}{\diff Q} \]


** Average cost
- The *average cost* is the ratio between total cost and production:
  \[ \CMe = \frac{C}{Q} \]
- The *average fixed cost* and the *average variable cost* are defined
  in a similar way:
  \[ \CFMe = \frac{\CF}{Q} \qquad \CVMe = \frac{\CV}{Q} \]
- It is easy to check that
  \[ \CMe = \CFMe + \CVMe  \]


** Relationship between $\PMg$, $\PMe$, $\CMg$ and $\CMe$  (I)
- The variable cost is:
  \[ \CV = w L \]
- Dividing by the level of production, we get the average variable
  cost:
  \[ \CVMe = w \frac{L}{Q} = w\frac{1}{Q/L} = \frac{w}{\PMeL} \]
- On the other hand, the rate at which the $\CV$ changes per
  additional unit of $Q$ is the marginal cost:
  \[ \CMg = \frac{\diff \CV}{\diff Q} =
     w \frac{\diff L}{\diff Q} = w\frac{1}{\diff Q/\diff L} =
     \frac{w}{\PMgL} \]


** Relationship between $\PMg$, $\PMe$, $\CMg$ and $\CMe$  (II)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t30-sr05.pdf 0.55

- The shape of the average and marginal product curves determine the
  shape of the average and marginal cost curves.
- $\PMgL$ and $\PMeL$ have a shape of an inverted U.


** Relationship between $\PMg$, $\PMe$, $\CMg$ and $\CMe$  (and III)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t30-sr06.pdf 0.55

- The average and marginal cost curves are U-shaped.
- The $\CMg$ curve crosses the $\CVMe$ curve at the minimum of the
  average variable costs.


** Average variable cost and marginal cost curves

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t30-sr06.pdf 0.55

- When $\CMg < \CVMe$, the average variable cost decrease with $Q$.
- The average variable cost increases with production when $\CMg >
  \CVMe$.


** The average fixed cost curve

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t30-sr07.pdf 0.55

- The *average fixed cost curve* decreases as production increases:
  \[ \CFMe(Q) = \frac{r \Kbar}{Q} \]


** Average cost curve (I)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t30-sr08.pdf 0.55

- The $\CMe$ curve is the sum of the $\CVMe$ and the $\CFMe$ for each
  level of production.
- The $\CMg$ curve crosses the $\CMe$ curve at the minimum average cost.


** The average cost curve (and II)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t30-sr08.pdf 0.55

- The $\CMe$ curve decreases with $Q$ when $\CMg < \CMe$.
- The $\CMe$ curve is increasing when $\CMg > \CMe$.
