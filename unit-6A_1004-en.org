* Costs in the short-run


** Profit maximization

- A *rational* firm makes its decisions with the goal of *maximizing
  its profits*.

- We split the profit-maximization problem into two parts:

  + How to minimize the cost of producing any given output level.

  + How to choose the most profitable output level.


** Input markets

- The firm can use any amount of inputs at their market prices:

  + $w$ is the wage;

  + $r$ is the price of capital.


** Total cost

- *Total cost*: the market value of the inputs a firm uses in production.
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ C = r K + w L \]
  #+end_export

- Those inputs which the firm owns are valued at their *opportunity
  cost*.


** The short-run

- In the short-run:

  + The capital is fixed: $K = \Kbar$.

  + The firm can only alter its output level by varying its labor
    input.


** Fixed and variable costs

- *Fixed cost*: $\CF = r \Kbar$.

- *Variable cost*: $\CV = w L$.


** Total cost in the short-run

- The *total cost in the short-run*: $C = r \Kbar + w L$.

- It is the sum of fixed and variable costs:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ C = \CF + \CV \]
  #+end_export



* Costs curves in the short-run


** Total product function:

#+MATS: figcol fig-6A_1004-sr01-*.pdf 0.5

- Total product function:
    #+begin_export latex
  \[ Q = f(L) \]
  #+end_export


** The conditional labor demand function

#+MATS: figcol fig-6A_1004-sr02-*.pdf 0.5

- The *conditional labor demand* shows how much labor the firm should
  hire to produce a given output level.

- It is the inverse of the total product function:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ L(Q) = f^{-1}(Q) \]
  #+end_export


** The variable cost curve

#+MATS: figcol fig-6A_1004-sr03-*.pdf 0.5

- *Variable cost curve*:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \CV(Q) = w L(Q) \]
  #+end_export


** Total cost curve

#+MATS: figcol fig-6A_1004-sr04-*.pdf 0.5

- The *fixed cost* does not depend on the production level.

- The *total cost curve* is obtained by adding the fixed and the
  variable cost for each level of production.


** The cost curves in the short-run

- *Fixed cost curve*: $\CF = r \Kbar$.

- *Variable cost curve*: $\CV(Q) = w L(Q)$.

- *Short-run total cost*: $\CT(Q) = r \Kbar + w L(Q)$.


** Marginal cost

- The *marginal cost* is the rate at which total cost varies per
  additional unit of production:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \CMg(Q) = \frac{\diff C(Q)}{\diff Q} \]
  #+end_export

- The marginal cost can also be written as the derivative of variable
  cost with respect to $Q$:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \CMg(Q) = \frac{\diff \CF}{\diff Q} + \frac{\diff \CV(Q)}{\diff Q} = \frac{\diff \CV(Q)}{\diff Q} \]
  #+end_export


** Average cost curves

- *Average fixed cost*:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \CFMe(Q) = \frac{\CF}{Q} \]
  #+end_export

- *Average variable cost*:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \CVMe(Q) = \frac{\CV(Q)}{Q} \]
  #+end_export

- *Average cost*:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \CMe(Q) = \frac{C(Q)}{Q} = \CFMe(Q) + \CVMe(Q) \]
  #+end_export


** Relationship between $\PMg$, $\PMe$, $\CMg$ and $\CMe$  (I)

- Variable cost:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \CV = w L \]
  #+end_export

- Average variable cost:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \CVMe = w \frac{L}{Q} = w\frac{1}{Q/L} = \frac{w}{\PMeL} \]
  #+end_export

- Marginal cost:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \CMg = \frac{\diff \CV}{\diff Q} = w \frac{\diff L}{\diff Q} = w\frac{1}{\diff Q/\diff L} = \frac{w}{\PMgL} \]
  #+end_export


** Relationship between $\PMg$, $\PMe$, $\CMg$ and $\CMe$  (II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-6A_1004-sr05-*.pdf 0.5

- $\PMgL$ and $\PMeL$ have inverted U-shapes.


** Relationship between $\PMg$, $\PMe$, $\CMg$ and $\CMe$  (and III)

#+MATS: figcol fig-6A_1004-sr06-*.pdf 0.5

- The average and marginal cost curves are U-shaped.


** The average variable cost and marginal cost curves

#+MATS: figcol fig-6A_1004-sr06-*.pdf 0.5

- The average variable cost:

  + decreases if $\CMg < \CVMe$.

  + increases if $\CMg > \CVMe$.

  + attains its minimum when $\CMg = \CVMe$.


** The average fixed cost curve

#+MATS: figcol fig-6A_1004-sr07-*.pdf 0.5

- The *average fixed cost curve* decreases as production increases.


** The average cost curve (I)

#+MATS: figcol fig-6A_1004-sr09-*.pdf 0.5

- The $\CMe$ curve is the sum of the $\CVMe$ and the $\CFMe$ at each
  level of production.


** The average cost curve (and II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-6A_1004-sr08-*.pdf 0.5

- The average cost:

  + decreases if $\CMg < \CMe$.

  + increases if $\CMg > \CMe$.

  + attains its minimum when $\CMg = \CMe$.
