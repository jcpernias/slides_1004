* Price elasticity of demand


** Concept of elasticity
- *Elasticicity* measures how a variable responds to changes in
  another variable, /ceteris paribus/.


** Price elasticity of demand
- *Price elasticity of demand*: how does the quantity demanded respond
  to variations in the price, /keeping constant the rest of
  determinants of demand/.
- It is defined as the ratio of the percentage changes in both
  variables:
  \[ E_d = \frac{\text{percentage change in $Q^d$}}{%
    \text{percentage change in $P$}} = 
    \frac{\Delta\% Q^d}{\Delta\% P} \] 


** Relative variations

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t04-unicorn1.pdf 0.45

- Relative change in $P$:
  \[ \Delta\% P = \frac{P_{2} - P_{1}}{P_{1}} \cdot 100 \]
- Relative change in $Q^d$:
  \[ \Delta\% Q^d = \frac{Q_{2} - Q_{1}}{Q_{1}} \cdot 100 \]


** The sign of the  price elasticity of demand (I)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t04-unicorn1.pdf 0.45

- Elasticity in the arc $\overline{AB}$:
  \[ E_d = \frac{\Delta\% Q^d}{\Delta\% P} = -3 \]


** The sign of the  price elasticity of demand (and II)

- The price elasticity of demand is negative: price and quantity
  demanded move in opposite directions.


** Interpretation

- Elasticities are pure numbers; they have no units.
- An elasticity $E_d = -3$ indicates that the magnitude of the
  relative variation in the quantity demanded is 3 times greater than
  the relative variation in price.


** Elasticity along the demand curve

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t04-unicorn2.pdf 0.45

- Elasticity in the arc $\overline{BC}$:
  \[ E_d = \frac{\Delta\% Q^d}{\Delta\% P} = -1 \]
- In general, $E_d$ takes different values along the demand curve


** Elastic demand and inelastic demand

- In an *elastic* section of demand: the magnitude of the relative
  variation in $Q^d$ is higher than the relative variation in $P$:
  \[ E_d < -1\]
- In an *inelastic* section of demand: the magnitude of the relative
  variation in $Q^d$ is lower than the relative variation in $P$:
  \[ -1 < E_d \leq 0\]
- *Unitary elasticity*: the relative variations in $Q^d$ and $P$ 
  coincide, in absolute terms.
  \[ E_d = -1 \]


** Determinants of price elasticity (I)
- Existence of *substitutes*: The existence of good substitutes makes
  more elastic the demand of a good.

- *Market definition*: The higher is the accuracy when defining the
  market more elastic is the demand.


** Determinants of price elasticity (and II)
- *Fraction of total spending* that represents the expenditure in the
  good: Goods which represent a small fraction of the consumers’ budget
  tend to have inelastic demands. 

- *Time horizon*: Demand of a good tends to be more elastic the
  greater is the considered time horizon.


** Slope of demand(I)

- The *slope of demand* is the ratio of the *absolute* variations in the
  quantity demanded and the price:
  \[ \text{slope} = \frac{\text{variation in $Q^d$}}{%
    \text{variation in $P$}} = 
    \frac{\Delta Q^d}{\Delta P} \] 
- In contrast to the elasticity of demand, the slope of demand has units.


** Slope of demand(and II)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t04-unicorn11.pdf 0.45

- Slope in the arc $\overline{AB}$:
  \[ \frac{\Delta Q^d}{\Delta P} = \frac{200}{-10} = -20 \text{\ kg by \texteuro/kg} \]
- The slope of demand is negative: price and quantity demanded move in
  opposite directions.


** Slope and elasticity of demand

- The value of the slope depends on the measurement units of the
  quantity demanded and the price.
- The elasticities do not depend on the measurement units of the variables.
- We can write the price elasticity of demand depending on the slope
  of the demand curve:
  \[ E_d = \frac{100\cdot \Delta Q^d / Q^d}{100\cdot \Delta P / P } = 
     \frac{\Delta Q^d}{\Delta P} \frac{P}{Q^d} \]  


* Calculations of elasticities


** Arc elasticity (I) 
- We need two points in the demand curve.
- We calculate the percentage changes in the quantity demanded and the price:
  #+BEGIN_EXPORT LaTeX
  \begin{gather*}
    \Delta\% Q^d = 100 \cdot (Q^d_{2}-Q^d_{1})/Q^d_{1} \\
    \Delta\% P = 100 \cdot (P_{2}-P_{1})/P_{1} 
  \end{gather*}
  #+END_EXPORT
- Arc elasticity:
  \[ E_d = \frac{\Delta\% Q^d}{\Delta\% P} \]


** Arc elasticity (II)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t04-unicorn1.pdf 0.45

- $\Delta\% Q^d = 100\%$
- $\Delta\% P = -33.33\%$
- $E_d = -3$


** Arc elasticity (and III)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t04-unicorn3.pdf 0.45

- $\Delta\% Q^d = -50\%$
- $\Delta\% P = 50\%$
- $E_d = -1$ \textcolor{DarkRed}{!!!}


** Midpoint method (I)
- The arc elasticity provides different values depending on the direction of the change.
- To avoid this problem we can use the midpoint method to calculate the percentage variations:
  \[ \Delta\% Q^d = 100 \cdot \Delta Q^d/Q^d_m; \quad 
     \Delta\% P = 100 \cdot \Delta P / P_m \]
  where
  \[ Q^d_m = (Q^d_1 + Q^d_2) / 2; \quad P_m = (P_1 + P_2) / 2 \]


** Midpoint method (and II)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t04-unicorn4.pdf 0.45

- $\Delta\% Q^d = 66.67\%$
- $\Delta\% P = -40\%$
- $E_d = -1.67$


** Point elasticity (I)
- Starting from the same initial point, we can calculate different elasticities for increasingly smaller arcs.
- At the limit:
  \[ E_d = \lim_{\Delta P \to 0} \frac{\Delta Q^d}{\Delta P} \frac{P}{Q^d} = \frac{\diff Q^d}{\diff P} \frac{P}{Q^d} \]


** Point elasticity (and II)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t04-unicorn5.pdf 0.45

- Slope of the demand curve:
  \[ \frac{\diff Q^d}{\diff P} = -20 \text{\ kg per €/kg} \]


** Some special cases (I)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t04-elast8.pdf 0.45

- Perfectly inelastic demand:
  \[ Q^d = 17 \]
- $E_d = 0$.


** Some special cases (II)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t04-elast6.pdf 0.45

- Constant elasticity demand:
  \[ Q^d = \frac{30}{P^{1/2}} \]
- $E_d = -1/2$.


** Some special cases (III)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t04-elast7.pdf 0.45

- Constant elasticity demand:
  \[ Q^d = \frac{150}{P^2} \]
- $E_d = -2$.


** Some special cases (IV)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t04-elast9.pdf 0.45

- Perfectly elastic demand:
  \[ P = 3 \]
- $E_d = -\infty$


** Some special cases (and V)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t04-ingr1.pdf 0.5

- Linear demand curve:
  \[ Q^d = a - b P \] 
  where $a, b>0$.


* Elasticity and revenues


** Revenues

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t04-ingr3.pdf 0.4

- Total revenues is the quantity of money sellers receive in a particular
  market:
  \[ \IT_1 = P_1 \cdot Q_1 \]


** Variations in revenues (I)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t04-ingr4.pdf 0.4

- How do revenues vary with a change in price?
  #+BEGIN_EXPORT LaTeX
    \begin{gather*}
      \IT_{1} = P_{1} \cdot Q_{1} \\
      \IT_{2} = P_{2} \cdot Q_{2} 
    \end{gather*}
  #+END_EXPORT


** Variations in revenues (II)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t04-ingr5.pdf 0.45

- $\Delta \IT = \Delta P \cdot Q_1 + P_1 \cdot \Delta Q + \Delta P \cdot \Delta Q$
- $\Delta\% \IT \approx \Delta\% P + \Delta\% Q$


** Variations in revenues (III)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t04-ingr5.pdf 0.45

- $\Delta\% \IT \approx \Delta\% P + \Delta\% Q$
- If the demand is elastic:
  \[ |\Delta\% P| < |\Delta\% Q| \]
- In elastic sections of demand, when price falls revenues increase.


** Variations in revenues (and IV)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t04-ingr6.pdf 0.45

- $\Delta\% \IT \approx \Delta\% P + \Delta\% Q$
- If the demand is inelastic:
  \[ |\Delta\% P| > |\Delta\% Q| \]
- In inelastic sections of demand, revenues decrease when the price
  falls.


** Elasticity and revenues
- When demand is elastic, revenues and price move in opposite directions.
- When demand is inelastic, revenues and price move in the same
  direction.


* Other elasticities of demand


** Demand function
- The *demand function* relates the quantity demanded with all its
  determinants:
  \[ Q^d = Q^d(P, P_o, M, X, Y, Z, \dots) \]
  where:
  + $P$: price of the good.
  + $P_o$: prices of other goods.
  + $M$: consumers’ income.
  + $X, Y, Z, \dots$: other determinants.


** Function and curve of demand
- We obtain the *demand curve* giving specific values to all the
  determinants of demand except for the price of the good:
 \[ Q^d = Q^d(P, \overline{P}_o, \overline{M}, \overline{X}, 
    \overline{Y}, \overline{Z}, \dots) = Q^d(P) \]


** Partial derivatives
- The *patial derivatives* of the demand function measure the change in
  the quantity demanded when one of the determinants of demand changes,
 /keeping constant the values of the remaining of variables/.


** Cross elasticity
- The *cross-price elasticity* of demand measures the sensitivity of the
 quantity demanded of a good with respect to changes in the price of
 another good:
 \[ E_d^{P_o} = \frac{\partial Q^d}{\partial P_o}\frac{P_o}{Q^d} \]


** Substitute goods and complementary goods

- The elasticity with respect to the price of *substitute goods* is
  positive: $E_d^{P_o} > 0$.
- The elasticity with respect to the price of *complementary goods* is
  negative: $E_d^{P_o} < 0$.


** Income elasticity
- *Income elasticity* of demand measures the sensitivity of the
  quantity demanded of a good with respect to variations in consumers’
  income:
  \[ E_d^M = \frac{\partial Q^d}{\partial M}\frac{M}{Q^d} \]


** Normal and inferior goods
- The demand for *normal goods* increases with income. The income 
  elasticity of normal goods is positive: $E_d^M > 0$.
- If the demand of the good decreases with income, the *good* is
  *inferior*: $E_d^M < 0$.


** Luxury goods and basic goods
- *Normal goods* are classified by:
  + *Basic goods*: The consumption of the good increases in a lower
    proportion than income; $0 < E_d^M < 1$.
  + *Luxury goods*: The consumption of the good increases in a greater
    proportion than income; $E_d^M > 1$.


 
* Elasticity of supply


** Price elasticity of supply
- The *price elasticity of supply* measures how does the quantity
  supplied respond to variations, /ceteris paribus/, in the price of
  the good:
  \[ E_s = \frac{\diff Q^s}{\diff P}\frac{P}{Q^s} \]


** Determinants of the elasticity of supply
  - Flexibility with which sellers can adapt their production to
    changes in price.
  - Time horizon.
