* Price elasticity of demand


** Concept of elasticity

- *Elasticity* measures how a variable responds to changes in
  another variable, /ceteris paribus/.


** Price elasticity of demand

- *Price elasticity of demand*: how much the quantity demanded
  responds to variations in the price, /all other determinants of
  demand held constant/.


** Computation of the price elasticity

- It is computed as the *percentage change* in quantity demanded
  divided by the *percent change* in the price:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[
    E_d = \frac{\text{percentage change in $Q^d$}}{%
      \text{percentage change in $P$}} =
    \frac{\Delta\% Q^d}{\Delta\% P}
  \]
  #+end_export

** Percentage changes

- Percentage change in $Q^d$ and in $P$:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[
    \Delta\% Q^d = \frac{Q_{2} - Q_{1}}{Q_{1}} \cdot 100;
    \qquad
    \Delta\% P = \frac{P_{2} - P_{1}}{P_{1}} \cdot 100
  \]

** An example

#+MATS: figcol fig-1D_1004-unicorn10-*.pdf 0.46

- Elasticity in the arc $\overline{AB}$:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ E_d = \frac{\Delta\% Q^d}{\Delta\% P} = -3\]
  #+end_export


** Interpretation

- The price elasticity of demand is negative.

- The price elasticity is a pure number, with no units of measurement.

- An elasticity $E_d = -3$ indicates that the magnitude of the
  relative variation in the quantity demanded is 3 times greater than
  the relative variation in price.


** Elasticity along the demand curve

#+MATS: figcol fig-1D_1004-unicorn2-*.pdf 0.46

- Elasticity in $\overline{AB}$: $E_d = -3$.

- Elasticity in $\overline{BC}$: $E_d = -1$.


** Elastic demand and inelastic demand

- An *elastic* portion of the demand curve: $E_d < -1$.


- An *inelastic* portion of the demand curve: $-1 < E_d \leq 0$.

- *Unitary elasticity* of demand: $E_d = -1$.


** Determinants of price elasticity

- Existence of close substitutes.

- Market definition.

- Fraction of total spending.

- Time horizon.


** Slope of the demand curve

- The *slope of demand* is the ratio of the *absolute* variations in
  the quantity demanded and the price:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[
    \text{slope} = \frac{\text{variation in $Q^d$}}{%
      \text{variation in $P$}} = \frac{\Delta Q^d}{\Delta P}
  \]
  #+end_export

** Slope of demand and price elasticity (I)

- Like price elasticity, the slope of demand is negative.

- Unlike price elasticity, the slope of demand depends on the
  units of the quantity demanded and the price.


** Slope of demand and price elasticity (II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1D_1004-unicorn11-*.pdf 0.46

- Elasticity in the arc $\overline{AB}$:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ E_d = \frac{\Delta\% Q^d}{\Delta\% P} = -3\]
  #+end_export

- Slope in the arc $\overline{AB}$:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[
    \frac{\Delta Q^d}{\Delta P} =
    -20 \text{\ kg by \texteuro/kg}
  \]
  #+end_export



** Slope of demand and price elasticity (and III)

- We can write the price elasticity of demand by means of the slope of
  the demand curve:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[
    E_d = \frac{\Delta Q^d}{\Delta P} \frac{P}{Q^d}
  \]
  #+end_export


* Computation of the price elasticity


** Arc elasticity (I)

- We only need two points in the demand curve.

- Percentage changes in the quantity demanded and the price:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[
    \Delta\% Q^d = 100 \cdot (Q^d_{2}-Q^d_{1})/Q^d_{1} \qquad
    \Delta\% P = 100 \cdot (P_{2}-P_{1})/P_{1}
  \]
  #+end_export

- Arc elasticity:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[
    E_d = \frac{\Delta\% Q^d}{\Delta\% P}
  \]
  #+end_export


** Arc elasticity (II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1D_1004-unicorn10-*.pdf 0.45

- After a price drop: $E_d = -3$.


** Arc elasticity (and III)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1D_1004-unicorn3-*.pdf 0.45

- After a price increase: \textcolor{DarkRed}{¡¡¡} $E_d =-1$
  \textcolor{DarkRed}{!!!}


** The midpoint formula (I)

- The midpoint formula computes percentage changes differently:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[
    \Delta\% Q^d = 100 \cdot \Delta Q^d/Q^d_m; \quad
    \Delta\% P = 100 \cdot \Delta P / P_m
  \]
  #+end_export
  where
  #+begin_export latex
  \[
    Q^d_m = (Q^d_1 + Q^d_2) / 2; \quad P_m = (P_1 + P_2) / 2
  \]
  #+end_export


** The midpoint formula (and II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1D_1004-unicorn4-*.pdf 0.45

- The result is independent of the direction of the price change:
  \[E_d = -1.67\].


** Point elasticity (I)

- Starting from the same initial point, we can calculate different
  elasticities for increasingly smaller arcs.

- At the limit:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[
    E_d = \lim_{\Delta P \to 0} \frac{\Delta Q^d}{\Delta P}
    \frac{P}{Q^d} = \frac{\diff Q^d}{\diff P} \frac{P}{Q^d}
  \]
  #+end_export


** Point elasticity (and II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1D_1004-unicorn5-*.pdf 0.45

- Elasticity in different point of the demand curve:


** Some special cases (I)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1D_1004-elast8-*.pdf 0.45

- Perfectly inelastic demand:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ Q^d = 17 \]
  #+end_export

- $E_d = 0$.


** Some special cases (II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1D_1004-elast9-*.pdf 0.45

- Perfectly elastic demand:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ P = 3 \]
  #+end_export

- $E_d = -\infty$


** Some special cases (and III)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1D_1004-ingr1-*.pdf 0.5

- Linear demand curve:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ Q^d = a - b P \]
  #+end_export
  where $a, b>0$.

* Price elasticity and total revenue


** Total revenue

#+MATS: figcol fig-1D_1004-ingr3-*.pdf 0.4

- Sellers' total revenue:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[
    \IT_1 = P_1 \cdot Q_1
  \]
  #+end_export


** Variations in revenues (I)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1D_1004-ingr4-*.pdf 0.4

- How does total revenue vary with a change in price?
  #+begin_export latex
    \begin{gather*}
      \IT_{1} = P_{1} \cdot Q_{1} \\
      \IT_{2} = P_{2} \cdot Q_{2}
    \end{gather*}
  #+end_export


** Variations in revenues (II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1D_1004-ingr5-*.pdf 0.45

- $\Delta \IT = \Delta P \cdot Q_1 + P_1 \cdot \Delta Q + \Delta P
  \cdot \Delta Q$

- $\Delta\% \IT \approx \Delta\% P + \Delta\% Q$


** Variations in revenues (III)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1D_1004-ingr5-*.pdf 0.45

- $\Delta\% \IT \approx \Delta\% P + \Delta\% Q$

- If the demand is elastic:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[
    |\Delta\% P| < |\Delta\% Q|
  \]
  #+end_export

- In elastic sections of demand, when price falls revenues increase.


** Variations in revenues (and IV)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1D_1004-ingr6-*.pdf 0.45

- $\Delta\% \IT \approx \Delta\% P + \Delta\% Q$

- If the demand is inelastic:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[
    |\Delta\% P| > |\Delta\% Q|
  \]
  #+end_export

- In inelastic sections of demand, revenues decrease when the price
  falls.


** Elasticity and revenues
- When demand is elastic, revenues and price move in opposite
  directions.

- When demand is inelastic, revenues and price move in the same
  direction.


* Other elasticities of demand


** Partial derivatives

- The *partial derivatives* of the demand function measure the change
  in the quantity demanded when one of the determinants of demand
  changes, /the values of the remaining determinants held constant/.


** Cross elasticity

- The *cross-price elasticity* of demand measures the sensitivity of
  the quantity demanded of a good with respect to changes in the price
  of another good:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[
    E_d^{P_o} = \frac{\partial Q^d}{\partial P_o}\frac{P_o}{Q^d}
  \]
  #+end_export


** Substitute goods and complementary goods

- *Substitute goods*: $E_d^{P_o} > 0$.

- *Complementary goods*: $E_d^{P_o} < 0$.


** Income elasticity

- *Income elasticity* of demand measures the sensitivity of the
  quantity demanded of a good with respect to variations in consumers’
  income:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[
    E_d^M = \frac{\partial Q^d}{\partial M}\frac{M}{Q^d}
  \]
  #+end_export


** Normal and inferior goods

- *Normal goods*: $E_d^M > 0$.

- *Inferior goods*: $E_d^M < 0$.


** Luxury goods and basic goods

- *Normal goods* are classified by:

  + *Necessity goods*: $0 < E_d^M < 1$.

  + *Luxury goods*:  $E_d^M > 1$.


* Elasticity of supply


** Price elasticity of supply

- The *price elasticity of supply* measures how does the quantity
  supplied respond to variations, /ceteris paribus/, in the price of
  the good:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[
    E_s = \frac{\diff Q^s}{\diff P}\frac{P}{Q^s}
  \]
  #+end_export


** Determinants of the elasticity of supply

- Ease with which production can adapt to price changes.

- Time horizon.


** Some cases (I)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1D_1004-elast10-*.pdf 0.4

- Perfectly inelastic supply:
  \[E_s = 0\]


** Some cases (II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1D_1004-elast11-*.pdf 0.4

- An inelastic portion of the supply curve:
  \[E_s = 0.44\]


** Some cases (III)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1D_1004-elast12-*.pdf 0.4

- An elastic portion of the supply curve:
  \[E_s = 1.75\]


** Some cases (and IV)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1D_1004-elast13-*.pdf 0.4

- Perfectly elastic supply:
  \[E_s = \infty\]
