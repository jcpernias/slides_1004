* Price elasticity of demand


** Concept of elasticity

- *Elasticicity* measures how a variable responds to changes in
  another variable, /ceteris paribus/.


** Price elasticity of demand

- *Price elasticity of demand*: how does the quantity demanded respond
  to variations in the price, /keeping constant the rest of
  determinants of demand/.

- It is defined as the ratio of the percentage changes in both
  variables:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[
    E_d = \frac{\text{percentage change in $Q^d$}}{%
      \text{percentage change in $P$}} =
    \frac{\Delta\% Q^d}{\Delta\% P}
  \]
  #+end_export


** Relative variations

#+MATS: figcol fig-1D_1004-unicorn10-*.pdf 0.45

- Relative change in $P$:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \Delta\% P = \frac{P_{2} - P_{1}}{P_{1}} \cdot 100 \]
  #+end_export

- Relative change in $Q^d$:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \Delta\% Q^d = \frac{Q_{2} - Q_{1}}{Q_{1}} \cdot 100 \]
  #+end_export


** The sign of the  price elasticity of demand (I)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1D_1004-unicorn10-*.pdf 0.45

- Elasticity in the arc $\overline{AB}$:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ E_d = \frac{\Delta\% Q^d}{\Delta\% P} = -3 \]
  #+end_export


** The sign of the  price elasticity of demand (and II)

- The price elasticity of demand is negative: price and quantity
  demanded move in opposite directions.


** Interpretation

- Elasticities are pure numbers; they have no units.

- An elasticity $E_d = -3$ indicates that the magnitude of the
  relative variation in the quantity demanded is 3 times greater than
  the relative variation in price.


** Elasticity along the demand curve

#+MATS: figcol fig-1D_1004-unicorn2-*.pdf 0.45

- Elasticity in the arc $\overline{BC}$:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ E_d = \frac{\Delta\% Q^d}{\Delta\% P} = -1 \]
  #+end_export

- In general, $E_d$ takes different values along the demand curve


** Elastic demand and inelastic demand

- In an *elastic* section of demand: the magnitude of the relative
  variation in $Q^d$ is higher than the relative variation in $P$:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ E_d < -1\]
  #+end_export

- In an *inelastic* section of demand: the magnitude of the relative
  variation in $Q^d$ is lower than the relative variation in $P$:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ -1 < E_d \leq 0\]
  #+end_export

- *Unitary elasticity*: the relative variations in $Q^d$ and $P$
  coincide, in absolute terms.
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ E_d = -1 \]
  #+end_export


** Determinants of price elasticity (I)

- Existence of *substitutes*: The existence of good substitutes makes
  more elastic the demand of a good.

- *Market definition*: The higher is the accuracy when defining the
  market more elastic is the demand.


** Determinants of price elasticity (and II)

- *Fraction of total spending* that represents the expenditure in the
  good: Goods which represent a small fraction of the consumers’
  budget tend to have inelastic demands.

- *Time horizon*: Demand of a good tends to be more elastic the
  greater is the considered time horizon.


** Slope of demand(I)

- The *slope of demand* is the ratio of the *absolute* variations in
  the quantity demanded and the price:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[
    \text{slope} = \frac{\text{variation in $Q^d$}}{%
      \text{variation in $P$}} = \frac{\Delta Q^d}{\Delta P}
  \]
  #+end_export

- In contrast to the elasticity of demand, the slope of demand has
  units.


** Slope of demand(and II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1D_1004-unicorn11-*.pdf 0.45

- Slope in the arc $\overline{AB}$:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[
    \frac{\Delta Q^d}{\Delta P} = \frac{200}{-10} =
    -20 \text{\ kg by \texteuro/kg}
  \]
  #+end_export

- The slope of demand is negative: price and quantity demanded move in
  opposite directions.


** Slope and elasticity of demand

- The value of the slope depends on the measurement units of the
  quantity demanded and the price.

- The elasticities do not depend on the measurement units of the variables.

- We can write the price elasticity of demand depending on the slope
  of the demand curve:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[
    E_d = \frac{100\cdot \Delta Q^d / Q^d}{100\cdot \Delta P / P } =
    \frac{\Delta Q^d}{\Delta P} \frac{P}{Q^d}
  \]
  #+end_export


* Calculations of elasticities


** Arc elasticity (I)

- We need two points in the demand curve.

- We calculate the percentage changes in the quantity demanded and the
  price:
  #+begin_export latex
  \begin{gather*}
    \Delta\% Q^d = 100 \cdot (Q^d_{2}-Q^d_{1})/Q^d_{1} \\
    \Delta\% P = 100 \cdot (P_{2}-P_{1})/P_{1}
  \end{gather*}
  #+end_export

- Arc elasticity:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[
    E_d = \frac{\Delta\% Q^d}{\Delta\% P}
  \]
  #+end_export


** Arc elasticity (II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1D_1004-unicorn10-*.pdf 0.45

- $\Delta\% Q^d = 100\%$

- $\Delta\% P = -33.33\%$

- $E_d = -3$


** Arc elasticity (and III)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1D_1004-unicorn3-*.pdf 0.45

- $\Delta\% Q^d = -50\%$

- $\Delta\% P = 50\%$

- $E_d = -1$ \textcolor{DarkRed}{!!!}


** Midpoint method (I)
- The arc elasticity provides different values depending on the
  direction of the change.

- To avoid this problem we can use the midpoint method to calculate the percentage variations:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[
    \Delta\% Q^d = 100 \cdot \Delta Q^d/Q^d_m; \quad
    \Delta\% P = 100 \cdot \Delta P / P_m
  \]
  #+end_export
  where
  #+begin_export latex
  \[
    Q^d_m = (Q^d_1 + Q^d_2) / 2; \quad P_m = (P_1 + P_2) / 2
  \]
  #+end_export


** Midpoint method (and II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1D_1004-unicorn4-*.pdf 0.45

- $\Delta\% Q^d = 66.67\%$

- $\Delta\% P = -40\%$

- $E_d = -1.67$


** Point elasticity (I)

- Starting from the same initial point, we can calculate different
  elasticities for increasingly smaller arcs.

- At the limit:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[
    E_d = \lim_{\Delta P \to 0} \frac{\Delta Q^d}{\Delta P}
    \frac{P}{Q^d} = \frac{\diff Q^d}{\diff P} \frac{P}{Q^d}
  \]
  #+end_export


** Point elasticity (and II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1D_1004-unicorn5-*.pdf 0.45

- Slope of the demand curve:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[
    \frac{\diff Q^d}{\diff P} = -20 \text{\ kg per €/kg}
  \]
  #+end_export


** Some special cases (I)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1D_1004-elast8-*.pdf 0.45

- Perfectly inelastic demand:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ Q^d = 17 \]
  #+end_export

- $E_d = 0$.


** Some special cases (II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1D_1004-elast6-*.pdf 0.45

- Constant elasticity demand:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ Q^d = \frac{30}{P^{1/2}} \]
  #+end_export

- $E_d = -1/2$.


** Some special cases (III)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1D_1004-elast7-*.pdf 0.45

- Constant elasticity demand:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ Q^d = \frac{150}{P^2} \]
  #+end_export

- $E_d = -2$.


** Some special cases (IV)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1D_1004-elast9-*.pdf 0.45

- Perfectly elastic demand:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ P = 3 \]
  #+end_export

- $E_d = -\infty$


** Some special cases (and V)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1D_1004-ingr1-*.pdf 0.5

- Linear demand curve:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ Q^d = a - b P \]
  #+end_export
  where $a, b>0$.


* Elasticity and revenues


** Revenues

#+MATS: figcol fig-1D_1004-ingr3-*.pdf 0.4

- Total revenues is the quantity of money sellers receive in a particular
  market:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[
    \IT_1 = P_1 \cdot Q_1
  \]
  #+end_export


** Variations in revenues (I)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1D_1004-ingr4-*.pdf 0.4

- How do revenues vary with a change in price?
  #+begin_export latex
    \begin{gather*}
      \IT_{1} = P_{1} \cdot Q_{1} \\
      \IT_{2} = P_{2} \cdot Q_{2}
    \end{gather*}
  #+end_export


** Variations in revenues (II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1D_1004-ingr5-*.pdf 0.45

- $\Delta \IT = \Delta P \cdot Q_1 + P_1 \cdot \Delta Q + \Delta P
  \cdot \Delta Q$

- $\Delta\% \IT \approx \Delta\% P + \Delta\% Q$


** Variations in revenues (III)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1D_1004-ingr5-*.pdf 0.45

- $\Delta\% \IT \approx \Delta\% P + \Delta\% Q$

- If the demand is elastic:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[
    |\Delta\% P| < |\Delta\% Q|
  \]
  #+end_export

- In elastic sections of demand, when price falls revenues increase.


** Variations in revenues (and IV)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1D_1004-ingr6-*.pdf 0.45

- $\Delta\% \IT \approx \Delta\% P + \Delta\% Q$

- If the demand is inelastic:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[
    |\Delta\% P| > |\Delta\% Q|
  \]
  #+end_export

- In inelastic sections of demand, revenues decrease when the price
  falls.


** Elasticity and revenues
- When demand is elastic, revenues and price move in opposite
  directions.

- When demand is inelastic, revenues and price move in the same
  direction.


* Other elasticities of demand


** Demand function

- The *demand function* relates the quantity demanded with all its
  determinants:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ Q^d = Q^d(P, P_o, M, X, Y, Z, \dots) \]
  #+end_export
  where:

  + $P$: price of the good.

  + $P_o$: prices of other goods.

  + $M$: consumers’ income.

  + $X, Y, Z, \dots$: other determinants.


** Function and curve of demand

- We obtain the *demand curve* giving specific values to all the
  determinants of demand except for the price of the good:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[
    Q^d = Q^d(P, \overline{P}_o, \overline{M}, \overline{X},
    \overline{Y}, \overline{Z}, \dots) = Q^d(P)
  \]
  #+end_export


** Partial derivatives

- The *patial derivatives* of the demand function measure the change
  in the quantity demanded when one of the determinants of demand
  changes, /keeping constant the values of the remaining of
  variables/.


** Cross elasticity

- The *cross-price elasticity* of demand measures the sensitivity of
  the quantity demanded of a good with respect to changes in the price
  of another good:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[
    E_d^{P_o} = \frac{\partial Q^d}{\partial P_o}\frac{P_o}{Q^d}
  \]
  #+end_export


** Substitute goods and complementary goods

- The elasticity with respect to the price of *substitute goods* is
  positive: $E_d^{P_o} > 0$.

- The elasticity with respect to the price of *complementary goods* is
  negative: $E_d^{P_o} < 0$.


** Income elasticity

- *Income elasticity* of demand measures the sensitivity of the
  quantity demanded of a good with respect to variations in consumers’
  income:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[
    E_d^M = \frac{\partial Q^d}{\partial M}\frac{M}{Q^d}
  \]
  #+end_export


** Normal and inferior goods

- The demand for *normal goods* increases with income. The income
  elasticity of normal goods is positive: $E_d^M > 0$.

- If the demand of the good decreases with income, the *good* is
  *inferior*: $E_d^M < 0$.


** Luxury goods and basic goods

- *Normal goods* are classified by:

  + *Basic goods*: The consumption of the good increases in a lower
    proportion than income: $0 < E_d^M < 1$.

  + *Luxury goods*: The consumption of the good increases in a greater
    proportion than income: $E_d^M > 1$.



* Elasticity of supply


** Price elasticity of supply

- The *price elasticity of supply* measures how does the quantity
  supplied respond to variations, /ceteris paribus/, in the price of
  the good:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[
    E_s = \frac{\diff Q^s}{\diff P}\frac{P}{Q^s}
  \]
  #+end_export


** Determinants of the elasticity of supply

- Flexibility with which sellers can adapt their production to changes
  in price.

- Time horizon.
