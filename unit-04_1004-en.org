* Introduction


** Government intervention

- Institutions: national security, domestic order, administration of
  justice, etc.

- Taxes, subsidies and transfers.

- Regulation.


** Justification

- Reasons for Government intervention:

  + *Market failures* undermine *economic efficiency*.

  + *Equity*: income redistribution.


* Controls on prices


** Price regulation

- The government considers that some markets harm buyers or sellers,
  and it imposes limits on the prices of some goods.

- Which are the consequences of price controls in a *competitive market*?


** Price ceilings (I)

- The government tries to reduce the price paid by buyers.

- The market price is not allowed to rise above a *maximum price*:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ P \leq \Pmax \]
  #+end_export


** Price ceilings (II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-04_1004-pmax2-*.pdf 0.48

- When the equilibrium price is below the price ceiling the regulation
  has no effect.


** Price ceilings (and III)

#+MATS: figcol fig-04_1004-pmax3-*.pdf 0.48

- When the equilibrium price is above the price ceiling there is a
  shortage in the market.

- Buyers pay a lower price for the good but production is not enough
  to satisfy demand.


** Price floors (I)

- The government tries to raise the price received by sellers.

- The market price is not allowed to drop below a *minimum price*:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ P \geq \Pmin \]
  #+end_export


** Price floors (II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-04_1004-pmin2-*.pdf 0.48

- If the the equilibrium price is above the price floor, the
  regulation has no effect.


** Price floors (and III)

#+MATS: figcol fig-04_1004-pmin3-*.pdf 0.48

- When the equilibrium price is below the price floor there is a surplus
  in the market.

- Although sellers receive a higher price for the good, they do not
  find buyers for all of their products.


** Effects of price controls

- In a *competitive market* price controls hurt those they are
  trying to help.  There are often better alternatives.

- In *non-competitive markets* price controls can be effective.


* Taxes


** Sales taxes

- The government levies a tax of $t$ euros per unit sold in a market.

- How does this tax affect a *competitive market*?

- How is the burden of the tax distributed between buyers and sellers?


** A tax on sellers (I)

#+MATS: figcol fig-04_1004-st1-*.pdf 0.45

 - The tax is collected by sellers.

 - In addition to the production costs, the sellers have to pay the
   tax to the government.

 - The supply curve shifts upwards.


** A tax on sellers (II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-04_1004-st2-*.pdf 0.48

- In the new equilibrium the quantity sold, $Q_1$, is lower and the
  price paid by buyers, $P_1$, is higher.


** A tax on sellers (III)

#+MATS: figcol fig-04_1004-st4-*.pdf 0.48

- The *tax revenues* are $T = Q_1 t$, the number of units sold
  multiplied by the tax rate.


** A tax on sellers (and IV)

#+MATS: figcol fig-04_1004-st3-*.pdf 0.48

- *Incidence of the tax*: how the tax burden is distributed between
  buyers and sellers.

- The price paid by buyers increases by less than the amount
  of the tax.

- The price received by sellers decreases by less than the amount of
  the tax.


** A tax on buyers (I)

#+MATS: figcol fig-04_1004-bt1-*.pdf 0.45

- The tax is collected by buyers.

- Buyers have to pay both the price and the tax rate.

- The demand curve shifts downwards.


** A tax on buyers (II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-04_1004-bt2-*.pdf 0.45

- In the new equilibrium a lower quantity, $Q_1$, is sold and the
  price that sellers receive, $P_1$, is lower.


** A tax on buyers (III)

#+MATS: figcol fig-04_1004-bt4-*.pdf 0.45

- The *tax revenues* are $T = Q_1 t$, the number of units sold
  multiplied by the tax rate.


** A tax on buyers (and IV)

#+MATS: figcol fig-04_1004-bt3-*.pdf 0.48

- *Incidence of the tax*: how the tax burden is distributed between
  buyers and sellers.

- The price paid by buyers increases by less than the amount
  of the tax.

- The price received by sellers decreases by less than the amount of
  the tax.


** Incidence of taxes (I)

#+MATS: figcol fig-04_1004-inc1-*.pdf 0.45

- The tax incidence is *independent of who collects the tax*.

- The distribution of the tax burden between buyers and sellers
  depends on the elasticities of demand and supply.


** Incidence of taxes (II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-04_1004-inc2-*.pdf 0.45

- If supply is relatively more inelastic than demand, sellers
  support most of the tax burden.


** Impact of taxes (and III)

#+MATS: figcol fig-04_1004-inc3-*.pdf 0.45

- If demand is relatively more inelastic than supply, buyers
  support most of the tax burden.


** Taxes effects

 - When a sales tax is levied on a *competitive market*:

   + A smaller quantity is sold.

   + The tax burden is distributed between buyers and sellers,
     independently of how the tax is collected.

   + The tax burden falls more heavily on the less elastic side
     of the market.
