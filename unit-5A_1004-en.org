* Nature and objectives of the firm

** Firms
- Why do firms exist?
- If resources are efficiently allocated by the markets, why do we
  need firms?
- [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Coase][Ronald Coase]]: firms coordinate the production process avoiding the
  *transaction costs*: search, negotiation, trade secrets keeping,
  monitoring, etc.


** Production
- Using a particular *technology* firms combine *production factors*
  to obtain the *production goods* that will then be sold in the
  *goods markets*.
- *Production*: the process that transforms the production factors
  into products.


** Production factors
- Labour.
- Land.
- Raw materials.
- Capital.


** Capital
- The *capital goods* are those production factors which are
  production goods themselves.
- For example: machinery, tools, buildings and structures used for the
  production process.
- Capital as a factor of production corresponds to the concept of
  *physical capital*. Different from the *financial capital*: the
  amount of money needed to undertake or maintain a business.


** Technology
- *Technological restrictions*: to produce a determined amount of a
  good, only certain combinations of factors are *feasible*.
- A combination of factors is *technologically efficient* to obtain a
  particular level of production, if that level cannot be reached by
  reducing the use of any of the production factors.
- The *production function* indicates for each possible combination of
  factors which is the maximum production that can be obtained.


** Simplifications
- Firms use only two factors of production: labour, $L$, and capital,
  $K$.
- Infinite divisibility: the production factors, $K$ and $L$, and the
  level of production, $Q$, are continuous variables.
- The production function can be expressed as
  \[ Q = F(K, L) \]


** Temporal dimension of production
- The firm faces different restrictions depending on the time horizon
  in which production decisions are considered.
- We distinguish between two time horizons: the *short term* and the
  *long term*.


** The short term
- The firm cannot modify the level of usage of some of the production
  factors.
- There exist *fixed factors* of production.


** The long term
- The firm can choose the level of usage of all the production factors.
- All the factors of production are *variable factors*.



* Short term production

** Production with a variable factor
- In the short term capital is a fixed factor: $K = \overline{K}$.
- Short term production function:
  \[ Q = F(\Kbar, L) = f(L) \]
- The only way in which the firm can alter its level of production is
  to vary the usage of the variable factor.


** Total product

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t25-cp01.pdf 0.5

- The *total product* is the level of production obtained when $L$
  units of labour are used:
  \[ Q = f(L) \]


** Marginal product of labour

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t25-cp03.pdf 0.5

- The *marginal product of labour* is the rate at which production
  grows per additional unit of labour:
  \[ \PMgL = \frac{\diff Q}{\diff L} = \frac{\diff f(L)}{\diff L} \]


** The curve of marginal product (I)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t25-cp06.pdf 0.5

- The marginal product curve has shape of an inverted U.


** The curve of marginal product (and II)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t25-cp06a.pdf 0.5

- The $\PMgL$ is growing for low values of $L$.
- For values of $L$ higher than $L_C$, the $\PMgL$ decreases with $L$.


** The law of diminishing marginal product
- The *law of diminishing marginal product* states that, from a certain
  level of usage of the factor, as additional units of that factor are
  added, /keeping constant the level of the rest of the factors/, the
  increases in production that are obtained are decreasing over time.


** Technical efficiency (I)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t25-cp06b.pdf 0.5

- The $\PMgL$ is negative when $L > L_D$.
- Beyond $L_D$, additional units of labour cause decreases in total
  production.


** Technical efficiency (and II)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t25-cp08.pdf 0.5

- Production reaches a maximum at $L_D$.
- Higher levels of $L$, such as $L_1$, are not technically efficient.
- Using just $L_0$ units of labour the same production can be obtained
  than with $L_1$ units.


** Average product of labour

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t25-cp02.pdf 0.5

- The *average product of labour* is the number of units produced per
  hour of work:
  \[ \PMeL = \frac{Q}{L} = \frac{f(L)}{L}\]


** The curve of average product
#+figure: ./figures/fig-t25-cp07.pdf 0.5
- The curve of average product of labour has shape of an inverted U.


** Total, average, and marginal product (I)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t25-cp05.pdf 0.5

- The curve of $\PMeL$ is increasing when $\PMgL > \PMeL$.
- When $\PMgL < \PMeL$ the curve of $\PMeL$ has a negative slope.
- The $\PMeL$ is maximum when $\PMgL = \PMeL$.


** Total, average, and marginal product (and II)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t25-cp04.pdf 0.5

- Total product reaches a maximum at $L_D$, where $\PMgL = 0$.
- If $\PMgL = \PMeL$ the average product reaches a maximum at $L_E$.
