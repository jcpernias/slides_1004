* Nature and objectives of the firm


** Firms

- Why do firms exist? If markets efficiently allocate resources, do we
  really need firms?

- [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Coase][Ronald Coase]]: firms efficiently coordinate the production process by
  avoiding *transaction costs*: searching, bargaining, protecting
  trade secrets, monitoring, etc.


** Production

- *Technology* enables firms to combine *factors of production* to
  obtain the *produced goods* that will then be sold in the *goods
  markets*.

** Factors of production

- Labor.

- Land.

- Raw materials.

- Capital.


** Capital

- *Capital goods*: those factors of production which are themselves
  produced goods: machinery, tools, buildings and structures used for
  the production process.

- Capital as a factor of production corresponds to the concept of
  *physical capital* and differs from *financial capital*: the
  amount of money needed to undertake or maintain a business.


** Technology

- *Technological restrictions*: only certain combinations of inputs are
  *feasible* ways to produce a given amount of output.

- The *production function* indicates the highest output level that a
  firm can produce for every specific combination of inputs.


** Temporal dimension of production

- The kind of the decisions that firm faces in the *short-run* are
  very different than those made in the *long-run*.

** The short-run

- In the short-run, the firm cannot change the quantities of one or
  more inputs: there are *fixed factors of production*.


** The long-run

- In the long-run ,the firm can choose the quantities of all inputs: all
  the inputs are *variable factors*.


** Simplifications

- Firms only use two factors of production: labor, $L$, and capital,
  $K$.

- The production function relates output, $Q$, with the factors of
  production:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ Q = F(K, L) \]
  #+end_export

- Perfect divisibility of $K$, $L$, and $Q$.


* Production in the short-run


** Production with one variable factor

- In the short-run, capital is fixed: $K = \Kbar$.

- Short-run production function:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ Q = F(\Kbar, L) = f(L) \]
  #+end_export

- The only way in which the firm can increase its output level is by
  using more units of the variable input.


** The total product curve

#+MATS: figcol fig-5A_1004-cp01-*.pdf 0.5

- The *total product* curve relates output level and labor:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ Q = f(L) \]
  #+end_export


** The marginal product of labor

#+MATS: figcol fig-5A_1004-cp03-*.pdf 0.5

- The *marginal product of labor* is the rate at which production
  increases per additional unit of labor:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \PMgL = \frac{\diff Q}{\diff L} = \frac{\diff f(L)}{\diff L} \]
  #+end_export


** The marginal product of labor curve (I)

#+MATS: figcol fig-5A_1004-cp06-*.pdf 0.5

- The marginal product curve has an inverted U-shape.


** The marginal product curve (and II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-5A_1004-cp06a-*.pdf 0.5

- The $\PMgL$ curve is increasing for low values of $L$.

- The $\PMgL$ is decreasing for values of $L$ higher than $L_C$.


** The law of diminishing marginal returns

- *Law of diminishing marginal returns*: as additional
  units of an input are used, /holding all other inputs fixed/, a
  point will be reached at which the resulting additions to output
  decrease.

** Technical efficiency (I)

#+MATS: figcol fig-5A_1004-cp06b-*.pdf 0.5

- The $\PMgL$ is negative when $L > L_D$.

- If labor increases beyond $L_D$, total output decreases.


** Technical efficiency (and II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-5A_1004-cp08-*.pdf 0.5

- Using more than $L_D$ units of labor is not technically efficient.

- The output level at $L_0$ is the same as the one at $L_1$.


** The average product of labor

#+MATS: figcol fig-5A_1004-cp02-*.pdf 0.5

- The *average product of labor* is the amount of output per unit of
  labor:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \PMeL = \frac{Q}{L} = \frac{f(L)}{L}\]
  #+end_export


** The average product of labor curve

#+MATS: figcol fig-5A_1004-cp07-*.pdf 0.5

- The average product of labor curve has an inverted U-shape.


** Total, average, and marginal product (I)

#+MATS: figcol fig-5A_1004-cp05-*.pdf 0.5

- The $\PMeL$ curve:

  + is increasing when $\PMgL > \PMeL$.

  + is decreasing when $\PMgL < \PMeL$.

  + reaches its maximum when $\PMgL = \PMeL$.


** Total, average, and marginal product (and II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-5A_1004-cp04-*.pdf 0.5

- The total product curve attains a maximum at $L_D$, where $\PMgL =
  0$.

- The average product curve reaches its maximum at $L_E$, where $\PMgL
  = \PMeL$.
