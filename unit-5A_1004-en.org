* Nature and objectives of the firm


** Firms

- Why do firms exist? If resources are efficiently allocated by the
  markets, do we really need firms?

- [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Coase][Ronald Coase]]: firms coordinate the production process avoiding
  *transaction costs*: search, bargaining, protect trade secrets,
  monitoring, etc.


** Production

- Using a particular *technology* firms combine *production factors*
  to obtain the *production goods* that will then be sold in the
  *goods markets*.

- *Production*: the process that transforms production factors
  into final products.


** Production factors

- Labour.

- Land.

- Raw materials.

- Capital.


** Capital

- The *capital goods* are those production factors which are
  production goods themselves.

- For example: machinery, tools, buildings and structures used for the
  production process.

- Capital as a factor of production corresponds to the concept of
  *physical capital*. Different from the *financial capital*: the
  amount of money needed to undertake or maintain a business.


** Technology

- *Technological restrictions*: to produce a determined amount of a
  good, only certain combinations of factors are *feasible*.

- A combination of factors is *technologically efficient* to obtain a
  particular level of production, if that level cannot be reached by
  reducing the use of any of the production factors.

- The *production function* indicates the highest production level
  that a firm can produce for every specific combination of inputs.


** Simplifications

- Firms only use two factors of production: labor, $L$, and capital,
  $K$.

- Infinite divisibility: the production factors, $K$ and $L$, and the
  level of production, $Q$, are continuous variables.

- The production function can be expressed as
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ Q = F(K, L) \]
  #+end_export


** Temporal dimension of production

- The firm faces different constraints depending on the time horizon
  in which production decisions are considered.

- We distinguish between the *short-run* and the *long-run*.


** The short-run

- The firm cannot change the quantities of one or more factors of
  production: there are *fixed factors of production*.


** The long-run

- The firm can choose the quantities of all inputs: all the factors of
  production are *variable*.



* Production in the short-run


** Production with one variable factor

- In the short term capital is a fixed factor: $K = \Kbar$.

- Short-run production function:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ Q = F(\Kbar, L) = f(L) \]
  #+end_export

- The only way in which the firm can alter its output level is by
  varying the usage of the variable factor.


** Total product

#+MATS: figcol fig-5A_1004-cp01-*.pdf 0.5

- The *total product* is the level of production obtained when $L$
  units of labour are used:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ Q = f(L) \]
  #+end_export


** The marginal product of labor

#+MATS: figcol fig-5A_1004-cp03-*.pdf 0.5

- The *marginal product of labor* is the rate at which production
  increases per additional unit of labour:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \PMgL = \frac{\diff Q}{\diff L} = \frac{\diff f(L)}{\diff L} \]
  #+end_export


** The marginal product of labor curve (I)

#+MATS: figcol fig-5A_1004-cp06-*.pdf 0.5

- The marginal product curve has the shape of an inverted U.


** The marginal product curve (and II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-5A_1004-cp06a-*.pdf 0.5

- The $\PMgL$ increases with $L$ for low values of $L$.

- The $\PMgL$ decreases with $L$ for values of $L$ higher than $L_C$.


** The law of diminishing marginal returns

- The *law of diminishing marginal returns* states that as additional
  units of an input are used, /holding all other inputs fixed/, a
  point will be reached at which the resulting additions to output
  decrease.


** Technical efficiency (I)

#+MATS: figcol fig-5A_1004-cp06b-*.pdf 0.5

- The $\PMgL$ is negative when $L > L_D$.

- Additional units of labour beyond $L_D$ cause decreases in total
  production.


** Technical efficiency (and II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-5A_1004-cp08-*.pdf 0.5

- Production reaches a maximum at $L_D$.

- Higher levels of $L$, such as $L_1$, are not technically efficient.

- Using just $L_0$ units of labour the firm is able to reach the same
  output level than with $L_1$ units.


** The average product of labour

#+MATS: figcol fig-5A_1004-cp02-*.pdf 0.5

- The *average product of labour* is the number of units produced per
  hour of work:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \PMeL = \frac{Q}{L} = \frac{f(L)}{L}\]
  #+end_export


** The average product of labour curve

#+MATS: figcol fig-5A_1004-cp07-*.pdf 0.5

- The average product of labor curve is shaped as an inverted U.


** Total, average, and marginal product (I)

#+MATS: figcol fig-5A_1004-cp05-*.pdf 0.5

- The curve of $\PMeL$ is increasing when $\PMgL > \PMeL$.

- When $\PMgL < \PMeL$ the curve of $\PMeL$ has a negative slope.

- The $\PMeL$ is maximum when $\PMgL = \PMeL$.


** Total, average, and marginal product (and II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-5A_1004-cp04-*.pdf 0.5

- Total product reaches a maximum at $L_D$, where $\PMgL = 0$.

- If $\PMgL = \PMeL$ the average product reaches a maximum at $L_E$.
