* Introduction


** What is economics?

- The study of the *decisions* economic agents make in an
  *scarcity* environment.


** Positive economics and normative economics

- *Positive economics*: How does the economy /work/?

- *Normative economics*: How /should/ the economy /work/?


** Microeconomics and macroeconomics

- *Microeconomics* studies how *economic agents* make decisions and
  interact in the *markets*.

- *Macroeconomics* focuses on issues related to the economic system as
  a whole: *unemployment*, *inflation*, *economic growth*, etc.


** Fundamental economic problems

- *What* to produce?

- *How* to produce?

- *For whom* to produce?


** Thinking as an economist

- Consider all the *alternatives*.

- Evaluate the *costs* and *benefits* of each alternative.

- Economic agents respond to the *incentives* they face.

- Consider how different economic agents *interact*.


** Costs and Benefits

- Not all the costs and benefits correspond to monetary payments.

- *Opportunity cost*.


* Economic models


** Models

- A *model* is a simplified representation of a part of reality.


** Example: Map of the UJI

#+ATTR_LATEX: :options scale=0.35
#+MATS: figcol UJI.png 0.6

- What makes a model useful?

  + Selection.

  + Simplification.


** Models and reality (I)

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Robinson][Joan Robinson]]

#+ATTR_LATEX: :options scale=0.3
#+MATS: figcol joan_robinson_small.png 0.35

#+begin_tightquote
  "A model which took account of all the variation of reality would be
  of no more use than a map at the scale of one to one."
#+end_tightquote


** Models and reality (and II)

- If a model predictions are reliable, the realism of its
  assumptions is not so important.

- Even if a model does not produce correct predictions, it can still
  offer useful guidelines to improve the decision-making process.


** Economic models

- *Rational behaviour*.

- *Equilibrium*.

- *Marginal analysis*


* The production possibilities frontier

** Robinson Crusoe’s economics

- Robinson has just reached an island, surviving in that way to the
  sinking of his boat.

- In his current state and with the little he has been able to rescue
  from the sinking he can only work 8 hours a day collecting coconuts
  or fishing.

- He dedicates the rest of the time to recover and to write a book.


** Production

- We can represent some of the options Robinson has by the following
  tables:
  #+latex: \vspace*{1ex}
  #+begin_center
  #+MATS: fig fig-1_1004-tab_fpp1-*.pdf
  #+end_center


** Variables

#+MATS: col 0.57
- Coconut production:
  + $C$: kg of coconuts.
  + $L_C$: hours collecting coconuts.

#+MATS: col 0.43
- Fish production:
  + $\Pvar$: kg de fish.
  + $L_{\Pvar}$: hours fishing.



** Graphical representation

#+MATS: col 0.5
- Coconut production:

#+MATS: col 0.5
- Fish production:
  #+MATS: fig fig-1_1004-prod2-*.pdf


** Production options

- Robinson can decide how to distribute the 8 hours of labor between
  the different activities.

** The Production Possibilities Frontier (I)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1_1004-fpp1-*.pdf 0.45

- The *production possibilities frontier* is the set of different
  production options where *all* the production factors are used.


** The Production Possibilities Frontier (II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1_1004-fpp2a-*.pdf 0.45

- Describes the options Robinson has, but does not tell us which one
  he will choose.


** The Production Possibilities Frontier (and III)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1_1004-fpp1a-*.pdf 0.45

- The intersection points with the axes show the maximum production of
  each good.


** Feasible and infeasible options

#+MATS: figcol fig-1_1004-fpp2-*.pdf 0.45

- $A$ and $B$ are *feasible options*.
- $I$ is an *inaccessible option*.


** Efficiency in production (I)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1_1004-fpp3a-*.pdf 0.45

- Option $A$ is feasible but inefficient: it is possible to increase
  fish production without reducing coconuts production.
- Inefficiency exits when there unemployed resources or their
  allocation is inadequate.


** Efficiency in production (and II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1_1004-fpp3-*.pdf 0.45

- $B$ is an *efficient* production option.
- *Efficiency*: it is not possible to produce more of a good without
  changing the production of the other good.


** Opportunity cost (I)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1_1004-fpp4-*.pdf 0.45

- Starting from an efficient point, it is only possible to increase
  the production of a good giving up part of the production of other
  goods.


** Opportunity cost (II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1_1004-fpp5-*.pdf 0.45

- $\Delta \Pvar = 2.2$ kg of fish.
- $\Delta C = -4.25$ kg of coconuts.


** Opportunity cost (III)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1_1004-fpp5-*.pdf 0.45

- Opportunity cost:
  \[ \left|\frac{\Delta C}{\Delta \Pvar}\right| = 1.93 \]
- Moving from $B$ to $D$ implies giving up $1.93$ kg of coconuts by
  each additional kg of fish.


** Opportunity cost (and IV)
- In our example the opportunity cost of producing one additional unit
  of fish is *increasing*.
  #+latex: \vspace*{1ex}
  #+begin_center
  #+MATS: fig fig-1_1004-tab_fpp3-*.pdf
  #+end_center


** Slope and opportunity cost

#+MATS: figcol fig-1_1004-fpp6-*.pdf 0.45

- The negative *slope* of the production possibilities frontier shows
  the opportunity cost of producing more fish.


** Concavity and increasing opportunity costs

#+MATS: figcol fig-1_1004-fpp7-*.pdf 0.45

- Production possibilities frontier *concavity* shows the *increasing*
  opportunity cost of producing more fish.


** Application: Economic growth (I)

- With the production possibilities frontier we can describe the
  effects of *economic growth*.

- Economic growth may be due to a greater amount of production
  factors, factors quality improvements or technological improvements.


** Application: Economic growth (II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1_1004-gr2-*.pdf 0.45

- Economic growth makes the production possibilities frontier *shift*
  upwards and to the right.


** Application: Economic growth (III)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1_1004-gr3-*.pdf 0.45

- A technological improvement in both sectors.

- As a consequence the production of all sectors can increase.


** Application: Economic growth (and IV)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1_1004-gr1-*.pdf 0.45

- A technological improvement which affects *just* the fish
  production.

- Technical progress allows to obtain increases in the production of
  *all* the goods.
