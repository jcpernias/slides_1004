* Markets and competition


** Markets

- A market is the set of *buyers* and *sellers* of a particular good or
  service.


** Competitive markets (I)

- Characteristics:

  + *Homogeneous product*.

  + Large number of buyers and sellers.

  + *Perfect information*.


** Competitive markets (and II)

- Absence of *market power*.

- Buyers and sellers are *price-takers*.


* Demand


** Quantity demanded and price

- The *quantity demanded* of a good is the number of units that buyers
  want and are able to purchase in a certain period of time.

- The *price* of a good plays a central role when determining the
  quantity demanded.


** The law of demand

- *Law of demand*: /ceteris paribus/, when the price of a good
  increases, the quantity demanded decreases; when the price
  decreases, the quantity increases.


** The individual demand schedule and curve

- They show the quantity a consumer demands at each price.

- The *demand curve* has *negative slope*.

** Market demand

- The *market demand* is the sum of the quantities demanded by each one
  of the consumers.

** Market demand curve (I)

- Demand in a market consisting of three consumers (K, L and M):

** Market demand curve (and II)

- The market demand curve is the horizontal sum of the individual
  demand curves.

#+MATS: fig fig-02_1004-dtab3-*.pdf


** Variations in the price (I)

#+MATS: figcol fig-02_1004-d2-*.pdf 0.45

- When the market price is $P_A$ the quantity demanded is $Q_A$.


** Variations in the price (II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-02_1004-d3-*.pdf 0.45

- The market price falls to $P_B$, /ceteris paribus/.

- Now the quantity demanded is $Q_B$.


** Variations in the price (and III)

#+MATS: figcol fig-02_1004-d4-*.pdf 0.45

- Variations in the price of the good, /ceteris paribus/, are
  reflected in *movements along* the demand curve.


** Other determinants of demand (I)

- The *income* of consumers:

  + *Normal good*: the demand increases when income
    increases.

  + *Inferior good*: the demand decreases when income
    increases.


** Other determinants of demand (II)

- *Prices of other goods*:

  + *Substitute goods*:the demand increases if the price of a
    substitute good increases.

  + *Complementary goods*: the demand decreases if the price of a
    complementary good increases.


** Other determinants of demand (and III)

- *Market size*: the higher is the amount of consumers, the higher is
  the demand.

- Consumers *tastes*.

- *Consumers expectations*.


** Shifts in the demand (I)

#+MATS: figcol fig-02_1004-d5-*.pdf 0.45

- At the market price $P_A$ the quantity demanded is $Q_A$.


** Shifts in the demand (II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-02_1004-d6-*.pdf 0.45

- The price of a substitute good increases.

- At the same price, $P_A$, consumers demand more units.


** Shifts in the demand (and III)

#+MATS: figcol fig-02_1004-d8-*.pdf 0.45

- An increase in demand : $D \rightarrow D^{+}$

- A decrease in demand: $D \rightarrow D^{-}$


** Shifts and movements along the demand curve

- If only the price changes there is a *movement along* the demand
  curve; the *quantity demanded* varies.

- If another determinant of demand changes there is a *shift* in the
  demand; *demand* increases or decreases.


* Supply

** Quantity supplied and price

- The *quantity supplied* of a good is the one sellers can and want to
  sell in a certain period of time.

- The price of a good is one of the determinants of the quantity
  supplied.

- /Ceteris paribus/, as the price of the good increases the
  quantity supplied increases.


** The individual supply schedule and curve

- Indicate the quantity a firm wants to sell at each possible price.

- The *supply curve* has *positive slope*.

  #+begin_center
  #+MATS: fig fig-02_1004-otab-*.pdf
  #+end_center


** Market supply curve

- The *market supply* curve is the sum of the quantities supplied by
  each producer at every possible price.

- It is obtained graphically as the horizontal sum of the individual
  supply curves.

#+MATS: fig fig-02_1004-otab3-*.pdf


** Variations in the price

#+MATS: figcol fig-02_1004-s2-*.pdf 0.45

- A variation in the price, /ceteris paribus/, prompts a movement
  along the supply curve.


** Other determinants of supply (I)

- *The prices of the factors of production*: if an input price
  increases, the costs increase and the benefits fall. The quantity
  supplied decreases when the input prices increase.

- *Technology*: an improvement in the technology used to produce the
  good reduces production costs, so that the quantity supplied by
  firms increases.


** Other determinants of supply (and II)

- *Market size*: the higher is the number of producers, the higher is
  the supply.

- *Producers expectations*.


** Shifts in the supply (I)

#+MATS: figcol fig-02_1004-s3-*.pdf 0.45

- An increase in the supply: firms offer now a higher quantity at the
  same price.


** Shifts in the supply (and II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-02_1004-s4-*.pdf 0.45

- Increase in the supply: $S \rightarrow S^{+}$

- Decrease in the supply: $S \rightarrow S^{-}$


* Equilibrium


** Equilibrium

- At the *equilibrium price* the quantity demanded coincides with the
  quantity supplied.

- The equilibrium price *clears the market*:

  + Buyers have purchased everything they wanted to purchase.

  + Firms have sold everything they wanted to sell.


** Equilibrium price

#+MATS: figcol fig-02_1004-eq1-*.pdf 0.45

- The intersection between supply and demand determines the
  *equilibrium price*, $P^*$, and the *equilibrium quantity*, $Q^*$.

** Surplus

#+MATS: figcol fig-02_1004-eq3-*.pdf 0.45

- *Surplus*: the price exceeds the equilibrium price and suppliers are unable
  to sell all they want.


** Shortage

#+MATS: figcol fig-02_1004-eq4-*.pdf 0.45

- *Shortage*: the price is below the equilibrium price and the
  production is lower than the quantity consumers are willing to buy.


** Exchange points

#+MATS: figcol fig-02_1004-eq5-*.pdf 0.45

- For non-equilibrium prices, the quantity exchanged is determined by the
  shorter side of the market.

- Out of the equilibrium, one of the market sides is not satisfied.


** Equilibrium stability

- In situations out of equilibrium the forces of supply and demand tend
  to re-establish the equilibrium.

- If the price is too high, the surplus pushes the price down.

- If the price is too low, the shortage pushes the price up.


** Comparative statics

- How to predict the effects that the change in a variable exerts on
  the market equilibrium?

  1. Determine which curves are affected by the change.

  2. Determine in which direction each curve shifts.

  3. Compare the initial equilibrium with the new one.


** An increase in demand

#+MATS: figcol fig-02_1004-comp1-*.pdf 0.45

- The equilibrium price increases.

- The equilibrium quantity increases.


** A decrease in supply

#+MATS: figcol fig-02_1004-comp2-*.pdf 0.45

- The equilibrium price increases.

- The equilibrium quantity decreases.


** Shifts in both curves (I)

#+MATS: figcol fig-02_1004-comp3-*.pdf 0.45

- Large increase in demand.

- Small decrease in supply.

- Equilibrium price and quantity increase.


** Shifts in both curves (II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-02_1004-comp4-*.pdf 0.45

- Small increase in demand.

- Large decrease in supply.

- Equilibrium price increases, but quantity decreases.


** Shifts in both curves (and III)

- When both curves shift simultaneously, the results depend on the
  magnitude of the changes in both curves.

- In absence of more details, we can only predict the direction of the
  change in one of the variables.
