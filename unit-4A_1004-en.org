* The intertemporal choice
** The consumption\NL decision in two periods
- The consumer lives for two time periods.
- In each period he/she has a monetary income: $M_1$ in the first
  period and $M_2$ in the second one.
- He/she must decide which fraction of the income of each period is
  used for consumption: $C_1$ y $C_2$.

** The financial markets
- The consumer has access to a financial market where the interest
  rate is determined, $r$.
- In the first period it is possible to lend or borrow at the market
  interest rate.


** Intertemporal\NL preferences\NL (I)
- The consumer has regular preferences on $C_1$ and $C_2$.
- The slope at a point on a indifference curve is the \RMS{} with a
  negative sign.
- From the utility function, $U = U(C_1, C_2)$:
  \[\RMS = \frac{\mlabel{\UMgLabel_{C_1}}}{\mlabel{\UMgLabel_{C_2}}} \]

** Intertemporal\NL preferences\NL (and II)
- If $\RMS > 1$ the consumer is willing to give up more than 1 € of
  future consumption in exchange for increasing in 1 € present
  consumption: *preference for present consumption*.
- When $\RMS < 1$ the consumer values 1 € of future consumption more
  than 1 € of present consumption: *preference for future
  consumption*.

** The budget constraint\NL (I)

- The consumer always has the option of not borrowing and not lending
  money. In this case $(C_1, C_2) = (M_1, M_2)$.
- Access to the financial market provides him/her with more options.

** The budget constraint\NL (II)
- The consumer can borrow money to increase his/her consumption in
  period 1 above the income in that period:
  \[ C_1 - M_1 > 0 \]
- Consumption in period 2 would be equal to the remaining income after
  repaying the loan with the interests:
  \[ C_2 = M_2 - (1 + r) (C_1 - M_1) \]
- Intertemporal budget constraint when borrowing:
  \[ C_2 = M_2 + (1+ r) M_1 - (1 + r) C_1\]

** The budget constraint\NL (and III)
- The consumer can lend a part of his/her income in the first period. In this case:
  \[ M_1 - C_1 > 0 \]
- Consumption in period 2 would be higher than the income in that period:
  \[ C_2 = M_2 + (1 + r) (M_1 - C_1) \]
- Intertemporal budget constraint when lending:
  \[ C_2 = M_2 + (1+ r) M_1 - (1 + r) C_1 \]

** The intertemporal\NL budget constraint\NL (I)
 - In both cases we reach the same budget constraint:
   \[ C_2 = M_2 + (1+ r) M_1 - (1 + r) C_1 \]
 - We can rewrite the intertemporal budget constraint as:
   \[  M_1 + \frac{M_2}{1+ r} = C_1 + \frac{C_2}{1 + r} \]
 - The present value of the income flow is equal to the present value of the consumption flow.
 - The intertemporal budget constraint in terms of future values:
   \[  M_1(1+r) + M_2 = C_1(1 + r) + C_2 \]

** The intertemporal\NL budget constraint\NL (II)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t21-ciri02.pdf 0.55

- The slope of the intertemporal budget constraint is equal to $-(1+r)$

** The intertemporal\NL budget constraint\NL (and III)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t21-ciri03.pdf 0.55

- When the interest rate varies the intertemporal budget constraint
  pivots around the point of initial endowments.
- If $r$ increases, the line rotates clockwise.

** The intertemporal\NL choice\NL (I)
- The rational consumer chooses the combination of present and future
  consumption on his/her intertemporal budget constraint that brings a
  higher satisfaction level.

- If the solution is interior the tangency condition is fulfilled:
  \[ \RMS{} = 1 + r \]

** The intertemporal\NL choice\NL (II)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t21-ciri04.pdf 0.55

- The optimum choice in this case implies:
  \[ M_1 > C_1 \]
- The consumer lends a part of his/her income in the initial period.

** The intertemporal\NL choice\NL (and III)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t21-ciri05.pdf 0.55

- The optimum choice in this case implies:
  \[ M_1 < C_1 \]
- The consumer requests a loan in the first period.


** Saving
- Saving of consumer in the first period is
  \[ S = M_1 - C_1 \]
- When the consumer lends a part of his/her income saving is positive:
  \[ S = M_1 - C_1 > 0 \]
- When the consumer borrows in the first period saving is negative:
  \[ S = M_1 - C_1 < 0 \]

** The savings curve\NL (I)
- The *savings curve* indicates the quantity of income the consumer
  saves for each possible interest rate:
  \[ S = S(r) \]
- It is obtained by analysing the different choices of present and
  future consumption as the interest rate varies.

** The savings curve\NL (II)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t21-ciri06.pdf 0.55

- If consumption in the first period is of a normal good, an increase
  in the interest rate increases the savings of borrowers.
- The substitution effect and the income effect reinforce each other.

** The savings curve\NL (III)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t21-ciri07.pdf 0.55

- In the case of a lender, the income effect has the opposite sign of
  the substitution effect.
- For high interest rates, saving could decrease with the interest
  rate (although the savings would still be positive).


** The savings curve\NL (and IV)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t21-cisv01.pdf 0.55

- The individual savings curve can go back towards itself for high
  interest rates.
