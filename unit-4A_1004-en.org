* Introduction


** Consumption choice in two periods

- The consumer lives for two time periods.

- She has a monetary income $M_1$ in the first period and $M_2$ in the
  second one.

- She must decide which part of her income devotes to consumption in
  each period: $C_1$ y $C_2$.


** The financial markets

- The consumer has access to a financial market where she can lend or
  borrow money in the first period at the market interest rate, $r$.


* Intertemporal preferences


** Intertemporal preferences (I)

#+MATS: figcol fig-4A_1004-map01-*.pdf 0.50

- The consumer has regular preferences on $C_1$ and $C_2$, represented
  by the utility function $U = U(C_1, C_2)$.


** Intertemporal preferences (II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-4A_1004-rms01-*.pdf 0.50

- Marginal rate of substitution:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[\RMS = \frac{\mlabel{\UMgLabel_{C_1}}}{\mlabel{\UMgLabel_{C_2}}} \]
  #+end_export


** Intertemporal preferences (and III)

- If $\RMS > 1$ the consumer is willing to give up more than \money{1}
  of future consumption in exchange for \money{1} of present
  consumption: *preference for present consumption*.

- When $\RMS < 1$ the consumer values \money{1} of future consumption
  more than \money{1} of present consumption: *preference for future
  consumption*.


* The intertemporal budget constraint


** The endowment point

#+MATS: figcol fig-4A_1004-ciri01-*.pdf 0.55

- The consumer always has the option of neither borrowing nor lending
  money. In this case: $(C_1, C_2) = (M_1, M_2)$.

- The access to financial markets provides her with more options.


** The consumer borrows money

- The consumer can borrow money to increase period 1 consumption above
  the income in that period:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ C_1 - M_1 > 0 \]
  #+end_export

- Period 2 consumption would be equal to the period 2 income after
  paying back the loan with interest:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ C_2 = M_2 - (1 + r) (C_1 - M_1) \]
  #+end_export


** The consumer lends money

- The consumer can lend a part of her income in the first period:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ M_1 - C_1 > 0 \]
  #+end_export

- Consumption in period 2 would be higher than the income in that
  period:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ C_2 = M_2 + (1 + r) (M_1 - C_1) \]
  #+end_export


** The intertemporal budget constraint

- In both cases we get the same expression of the intertemporal budget
  line:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ C_2 = M_2 + (1+ r) (M_1 - C_1) \]
  #+end_export


** Present value

- We can rewrite the budget line as the equality between the present
  value of the income stream and the present value of the consumption
  stream:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[  M_1 + \frac{M_2}{1+ r} = C_1 + \frac{C_2}{1 + r} \]
  #+end_export


** Future value

- Alternatively, we can express the budget line in terms of future
  values of income and consumption streams:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[  M_1(1+r) + M_2 = C_1(1 + r) + C_2 \]
  #+end_export


** The budget line and the interest rate (I)

#+MATS: figcol fig-4A_1004-ciri02-*.pdf 0.55

- The slope of the intertemporal budget constraint is equal to $-(1+r)$


** The budget line and the interest rate (and II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-4A_1004-ciri03-*.pdf 0.55

- When the interest rate changes the intertemporal budget line pivots
  around the point of initial endowments.

- If $r$ increases, the line rotates clockwise.


* Consumer choice


** The optimal choice

- The consumer chooses a combination of present and future
  consumption on her intertemporal budget constraint.

- Tangency condition:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \RMS{} = 1 + r \]
  #+end_export


** Borrowers

#+MATS: figcol fig-4A_1004-ciri05-*.pdf 0.55

- The optimum choice in this case implies:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ M_1 < C_1 \]
  #+end_export

- The consumer borrows money in the first period.



** Lenders

#+MATS: figcol fig-4A_1004-ciri04-*.pdf 0.55

- The optimum choice in this case implies:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ M_1 > C_1 \]
  #+end_export

- The consumer lends part of her income in the initial period.


* Savings


** Savings


- Consumer savings:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ S = M_1 - C_1 \]
  #+end_export

- When the consumer lends part of her income, her savings are positive:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ S = M_1 - C_1 > 0 \]
  #+end_export

- When the consumer borrows in the first period, her savings are
  negative:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ S = M_1 - C_1 < 0 \]
  #+end_export


** The savings curve (I)

- The *savings curve* shows the amount of money that the consumer
  saves for every possible interest rate:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ S = S(r) \]
  #+end_export


** The savings curve (II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-4A_1004-ciri06-*.pdf 0.55

- If consumption in the first period is of a normal good, an increase
  in the interest rate increases the savings of borrowers.

- The substitution effect and the income effect reinforce each other.

#+MATS: pagebreak


** The savings curve (III)

#+MATS: figcol fig-4A_1004-ciri07-*.pdf 0.55

- In the case of a lender, the income effect has the opposite sign of
  the substitution effect.

- Savings could decrease with the interest rate for sufficiently high
  interest rates, although savings would still be positive.


** The savings curve (and IV)

#+MATS: figcol fig-4A_1004-cisv01-*.pdf 0.55

- The individual savings curve bends backwards for high interest
  rates.
