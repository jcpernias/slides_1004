* Consumer preferences


** Completeness
- The *completeness* assumption states that the consumer is able to rank any two baskets according to his preferences.
- If a consumer has to compare two baskets, $A$ and $B$,
  then:
  + either he prefers $A$ to $B$: $A \succ B$;
  + either he prefers $B$ to $A$: $B \succ A$;
  + or he is indifferent between them: $A \sim B$.


** Non-satiation (I)
- When the assumption of *non-satiation* is fulfilled a consumer
  prefers baskets containing more units of, at least one of the goods
  and not less of the other goods.


** Non-satiation (II)
- Under this assumption, we can say that:
  + $A = (2, 3) \succ B = (1, 3)$.
  + $A = (2, 3) \succ C = (1, 1)$.
- Only with this assumption we cannot determine how the consumer would
  rank the baskets $A=(2, 3)$ and $D = (1, 4)$.


** Non-satiation (and III)
#+figure: ./figures/fig-t11-ci02.pdf 0.45

- $M \succ A$.
- $A \succ P$.


** Indifference curves (I)
- An *indifference curve* is a set of baskets of consumption, and
  includes all baskets that are indifferent to each other.
- Each basket belongs to an indifference curve.


** Indifference curves (II)
#+figure: ./figures/fig-t11-ci03.pdf 0.45

- Baskets which are indifferent to $A$ cannot be in the shaded areas (non-satiation assumption).


** Indifference curves (III)
#+figure: ./figures/fig-t11-ci04.pdf 0.45

- We apply the same reasoning to other baskets indifferent to $A$.


** Indifference curves (IV)
#+figure: ./figures/fig-t11-ci05.pdf 0.45

- The indifference curve has a negative slope.


** Indifference curves (and V)
#+figure: ./figures/fig-t11-ci06.pdf 0.45

- Baskets preferred to $A$ are placed above and to the right of the indifference curve.
- None of the baskets placed below and to the left of the indifference curve is preferred to $A$.


** Transitivity (I)
- The *transitivity* assumption implies a certain type of consistency in the consumer preferences.
- If $A \succ B$ and $B \succ C$, then $A \succ C$.
- If $A \sim B$ and $B \sim C$, then $A \sim C$.


** Transitivity (and II)
#+figure: ./figures/fig-t11-tr01.pdf 0.45

- If the assumption of transitivity is fulfilled, each basket belongs
  to one and *only* one indifference curve.
- If the indifference curves intersect we find a contradiction:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[B \sim C \text{\ and\ } C \sim A\text{, but\ } B \succ A.\]
  #+end_export


** Indifference curves map

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t11-map01.pdf 0.45

- The *indifference curves map* represents the preferences of a consumer.


** Marginal Rate of Substitution (I)
- The *Marginal Rate of Substitution*, $\RMS$, measures the valuation
  by a consumer of a good in terms of another good.
- ¿To how many units of good $Y$, at most, would I be willing to give
  up in order to obtain another unit of good $X$?


** Marginal Rate of Substitution (II)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t11-rms01.pdf 0.45

- The $\RMS$ is the rate at which a consumer can replace a good for another, staying on the same indifference curve.
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \RMS \approx \left| \frac{\Delta Y}{\Delta X} \right|_{I_0} \]
  #+end_export


** Marginal Rate of Substitution (and III)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t11-rms02.pdf 0.45

- The $\RMS$ coincides with the slope, with negative sign, at a point
  of the indifference curve.


** Convexity

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t11-rms03.pdf 0.45

- The *convexity* of the indifference curves implies that the $\RMS$ is decreasing:
  #+BEGIN_EXPORT LATEX
  \[ \RMS(A) > \RMS(B) \]
  #+END_EXPORT

- The relative value a consumer assigns to a good is smaller the more
  units of that good are consumed.


** Regular preferences
- *Completeness*.
- *Transitivity*.
- *Non-satiation* (o *monotonicity*, o *insatiability*).
- *Convexity*.
- Other technical assumptions.



* Other cases: Consumer preferences


** Other cases of preferences (I)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t11-nreg01.pdf 0.45

- *Perfect substitutes*.


** Other cases of preferences (II)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t11-nreg02.pdf 0.45

- *Perfect complements*.


** Other cases of preferences (III)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t11-nreg03.pdf 0.45

- $Y$ is a *neutral good*.


** Other cases of preferences (and IV)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t11-nreg04.pdf 0.45

- $X$ is a *bad*.




* Utility function


** Utility function
- The *utility function* assigns a numerical value to each basket
  according to the consumer preferences, so that
  + if $A \succ B$, then $U(X_A, Y_A) > U(X_B, Y_B)$;
  + if $A \sim B$, then $U(X_A, Y_A) = U(X_B, Y_B)$.
- The preferences of a consumer, under certain assumptions, can be
  represented by a utility function.


** Utility function and indifference curves
- The utility function assigns the same number to all baskets which
  are indifferent to each other.
- We can obtain an indifference curve by finding all points that
  produce the same value of the utility function:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ U(X, Y) = \overline{U} \]
  #+end_export


** Example (I)
- Utility function:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ U(X, Y) = X \cdot Y \]
  #+end_export
- The utility associated with basket $A = (15, 20)$ is:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ U(15, 20) = 15 \cdot 20 = 300 \]
  #+end_export
- Indifferent to $A$ baskets produce the same value of the utility function:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ U(X, Y) = X\cdot Y = 300 \]
  #+end_export


** Example (and II)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t11-fu01.pdf 0.45

- Indifference curve which contains $A$:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ Y = \frac{300}{X} \]
  #+end_export


** Ordinal utility (I)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t11-map02.pdf 0.45

- The utility function assigns each indifference curve to a different number.


** Ordinal utility (II)
- The utility function values have no special meaning, apart from
  ordering the baskets.
- There are infinite utility functions that represent exactly the same
  preferences.


** Ordinal utility (and III)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t11-map03.pdf 0.48

- Let’s define $V(X, Y)$ as:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ V(X, Y) = \sqrt{U(X, Y)} = X^{1/2}  Y^{1/2} \]
  #+end_export
- Both $U(X, Y)$ and $V(X, Y)$ represent the same preferences.


** Marginal utility (I)
- The *marginal utility* of $X$ measures the variation in consumer’s
  utility with variations in the consumption of $X$, but /keeping
  constant the consumption of $Y$/.
- The marginal utility of a good coincides with the partial derivative
  of the utility function:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \UMX = \frac{\partial U(X, Y)}{\partial X}; \quad \UMY = \frac{\partial U(X, Y)}{\partial Y} \]
  #+end_export


** Marginal utility (and II)
- If the assumption of non-satiation is fulfilled:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \UMX > 0; \quad \UMY > 0. \]
  #+end_export
- Except for the sign, the value of marginal utility has no
  interesting interpretation.


** Marginal utility and RMS (I)

- Variation in utility when the consumptions of $X$ and $Y$ change
  simultaneously:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \diff U = \UMX\; \diff X + \UMY\; \diff Y \]
  #+end_export
- If the change occurs along an indifference curve, utility does not
  vary; so $\diff U = 0$:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ 0 = \UMX\; \diff X + \UMY\; \diff Y \]
  #+end_export


** Marginal utility and RMS (II)

- The slope of the indifference curve is:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \left. \frac{\diff Y}{\diff X} \right|_{U=\overline{U}} = -\frac{\UMX}{\UMY} \]
  #+end_export

- The marginal rate of substitution coincides with the ratio of marginal utilities:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \RMS =  \frac{\UMX}{\UMY} \]
  #+end_export


** Marginal utility and RMS (III)

- Example: $U(X, Y) = XY$.
- Marginal utilities:
  #+BEGIN_EXPORT LaTeX
    \begin{equation*}
     \UMX = \frac{\partial U}{\partial X} = Y;  \quad
     \UMY = \frac{\partial U}{\partial Y} = X
    \end{equation*}
  #+END_EXPORT
- Marginal rate of substitution:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[\RMS = \frac{\UMX}{\UMY} = \frac{Y}{X} \]
  #+end_export


** Marginal utility and RMS (and IV)

#+figure: ./figures/fig-t11-fu02.pdf 0.45

- $\RMS(A) = 20/15 = 1.33$ units of $Y$ per unit of $X$.
- The slope of the indifference curve at point $A$ is $-1.33$
  units of $Y$ per unit of $X$.


* Some utility functions


** Some utility functions
- Perfect substitutes:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ U(X, Y) = a X + b Y; \quad a, b > 0. \]
  #+end_export
- Perfect complements:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ U(X, Y) = \min\{a X, b Y\}; \quad a, b > 0. \]
  #+end_export
- Cobb-Douglas
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ U(X, Y) = X^a Y^b; \quad a,b > 0. \]
  #+end_export
