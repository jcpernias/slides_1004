* Substitution effect and income effect


** Law of demand

#+MATS: figcol fig-3B_1004-eres20-*.pdf 0.55

- An increase /ceteris paribus/ in $P_X$ reduces the demanded quantity
  of $X$.


** Law of demand?

#+MATS: figcol fig-3B_1004-eres22-*.pdf 0.55
- There is nothing in the consumer analysis that excludes the
  possibility of an increase in the demanded quantity when the price
  increases.


** Giffen goods
- A *Giffen good* is a good whose demand curve has a positive slope.
- Under which conditions does the demand curve have a positive slope?



* Changes in the price of a good


** Effects of price change
If the price of good $X$ increases:
- Relative prices change. The consumer tries to *substitute* the
  consumption of good $X$, now relatively more expensive, for other
  goods.
- The consumer has less consumption choices. His/her *real income*
  has decreased as a consequence of the price increase.


** Substitution effect and income effect
- The *total effect*, \ET, of a change in $P_X$ is the variation in
  the demanded quantity of good $X$.
- The *substitution effect*, \ES, is the part of the total effect that
  can be exclusively attributed to the change in relative prices.
- The *income effect*, \ER, is the part of the total effect that can
  be exclusively attributed to the change in real income.
- $\ET = \ES + \ER$


** Total effect split (I)
- How can we determine which part of the change is due to the
  substitution effect and which is due to the income effect?
- Let’s consider what would be the demanded quantity by the consumer
  if his/her real income had not change and just relative prices had
  changed: $X_H$.
- We can obtain the substitution effect and the income effect by
  comparing $X_H$ with the demanded quantities before the increase of
  the price, $X_0$ and after the increase of the price, $X_1$.


** Total effect split (and II)

- From the initial quantity demanded, $X_0$; the final quantity
  demanded, $X_1$; and the quantity demanded if just relative prices had
  changed, $X_H$, we can determine:
| Substitution effect: | $X_H - X_0$ | Just relative prices    |
|                      |             | change.                 |
| Income effect:       | $X_1 - X_H$ | Just real income changes. |
|                      |             |                           |
| Total effect:        | $X_1 - X_0$ | Both relative prices   |
|                      |             | and real income change.|


** Hicks decomposition

- Hicks equates real income to the utility level.
- If just relative prices change and real income is constant, the
  optimal basket must be in the same indifference curve that the
  initial choice.
- In order to decompose the total effect, we look for a point of the
  initial indifference curve where the \RMS{} coincides with the final
  relative prices.


** Example (I)
- Utility function: $U(X, Y) = X^{2/3}Y^{1/3}$.
- Monetary income: $M = 72$ €.
- Initial prices: $P_X = 2$ €/u. y $P_Y = 1$ €/u.
- Final price of $X$: $P'_X = 16$ €/u.


** Example (II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-3B_1004-eres02-*.pdf 0.55

- Total effect of the increase of $P_X$:
  #+BEGIN_EXPORT LATEX
  \[ \ET = 3 - 24 = -21 \]
  #+END_EXPORT


** Example (III)

#+MATS: figcol fig-3B_1004-eres03-*.pdf 0.55

- $E_H$: choice if real income does not change.
- $E_H$ is on the same indifference curve as $E_0$.
- The \RMS{} at $E_H$ is equal to the final relative price: $P'_X/P_Y$.


** Example (and IV)

#+MATS: figcol fig-3B_1004-eres04-*.pdf 0.55

- $\ES = 12 - 24 = -12$.
- $\ER = 3 - 12 = -9$.
- $\ET = \ES + \ER = -21$.



* Effect signs


** The sign of the substitution effect
- The *substitution effect* has a *negative sign*.
- The variation in quantity due to the substitution effect has the
  opposite sign with respect to the variation in price.


** The sign of the income effect
- An increase of the price implies a decrease of real income.
- If the *good is normal*, an increase of the price reduces demand as
  a consequence of the income effect. In this case, the *income
  effect* has a *negative sign*.
- If the *good is inferior*, a higher price makes causes an increase
  in demand through the income effect. In this case the *income
  effect* has a *positive sign*.


** Normal goods (I)
- The *total effect* of a *normal good* has *negative sign*:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \underset{(-)}{\ET} = \underset{(-)}{\ES}  +\underset{(-)}{\ER} \]
  #+end_export


** Normal goods (and II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-3B_1004-eres10-*.pdf 0.55
- Substitution effect and income effect reinforce each other.

- Demand curve with a negative slope.


** Inferior goods (I)

- The *total effect* of an *inferior good* can have a *negative or
  positive sign*:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \underset{(?)}{\ET} = \underset{(-)}{\ES}  + \underset{(+)}{\ER} \]
  #+end_export

- Frequently, the magnitude of the income effect is small compared to
  that of the substitution effect.
  #+BEGIN_EXPORT LATEX
  \[ |\ER| < |\ES| \]
  #+END_EXPORT
- In this case, the demand of an inferior good has a negative slope:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \underset{(-)}{\ET} = \underset{(-)}{\ES}  + \underset{(+)}{\ER} \qquad \big(|\ER| < |\ES|\big) \]
  #+end_export


** Inferior goods (and II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-3B_1004-eres11-*.pdf 0.55

- The income effect partially counteracts the substitution effect.
- Demand curve with negative slope.


** Giffen goods (I)

- A Giffen good is an inferior good whose income effect is greater, in
  absolute terms, than the substitution effect:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \underset{(+)}{\ET} = \underset{(-)}{\ES}  + \underset{(+)}{\ER} \qquad \big(|\ER| > |\ES|\big) \]
  #+end_export


** Giffen goods (II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-3B_1004-eres12-*.pdf 0.55

- The income effect is higher in absolute terms than the substitution
  effect.
- Demand curve with positive slope.


** Giffen goods (and III)

- Under which conditions can we find a Giffen good?
  + Inferior good.
  + Small substitution effect (by lack of good substitutes, for example).
  + Large income effect (the expenditure in the good represents an
    important share of the consumers budget, for example).



* Slutsky decomposition                                            :noexport:


** Slutsky decomposition (I)

- Slutsky identifies *real income* with *purchasing power*.
- The choice when just relative prices change must be on a budget line
  that allows you to buy the initial basket at final prices.


** Slutsky decomposition (II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-3B_1004-eres05a-*.pdf 0.55

- $E_S$: choice if real income does not change.
- $E_S$ is on a budget line that goes through $E_0$.
- The slope of this budget line coincides with the final relative
  price: $P'_X/P_Y$.


** Slutsky decomposition (III)

#+MATS: figcol fig-3B_1004-eres05-*.pdf 0.55

- $\ES = 17 - 24 = -7$.
- $\ER = 3 - 17 = -14$.
- $\ET = \ES + \ER= -21$.


** Slutsky decomposition (and IV)

#+MATS: figcol fig-3B_1004-eres06-*.pdf 0.55

- The proposals of Hicks and Slutsky generate different results.
- Both coincide when the variation in prices is very small or in cases
  in which the \ER{} is equal to 0.
