* Markets and competition


** Markets

- A market is the set of buyers and sellers of a particular good or
  service.


** Competitive markets

- Large number of *buyers*.

- Large number of *sellers*.

- *Absence of market power*.


** Perfect competition model

- Assumptions:

  + Homogeneous product.

  + Absence of market power.

  + Perfect information.

- Both buyers and sellers are *price-takers*.


* Demand


** Quantity demanded and price

- The *quantity demanded* of a good is the number of units of that
  good consumers want and can purchase in a certain period of time.

- The *price* of a good plays a central role when determining the
  quantity demanded.


** The law of demand

- *Law of demand*: /ceteris paribus/, when the price of a good
  increases, the quantity demanded decreases; when the price
  decreases, the quantity increases.


** The table and curve of individual demand

- The quantity a consumer wants to buy at each possible price.

- The demand curve has negative slope.

** Market demand curve (I)
- For each possible price we add the quantities demanded by each one
  of the consumers.

- Demand in a market consisting of three consumers (K, L and M):

** Market demand curve (and II)
- The market demand curve is the horizontal sum of the individual
  demand curves.

  #+end_center


** Variations in the price (I)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1C_1004-d2-*.pdf 0.45

- The market demand curve tells us the quantity consumers want to
  purchase at each possible price.
- When the market price is $P_A$ the quantity demanded is $Q_A$.


** Variations in the price (II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1C_1004-d3-*.pdf 0.45

- The market price has fallen to $P_B$.
- No other determinant of demand has changed.
- Now the quantity demanded is $Q_B$.


** Variations in the price (and III)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1C_1004-d4-*.pdf 0.45

- Variations in the price of the good, /ceteris paribus/, are
  reflected in *movements along* the demand curve.


** Other determinants of demand (I)

- The *income* of consumers:

  + *Normal good*: If demand increases when income increases.

  + *Inferior good*: If demand decreases when income increases.


** Other determinants of demand (II)

- *Prices of other goods*:

  + *Complementary goods*: they are usually consumed together. Demand
    increases if the price of a complementary good falls.

  + *Substitute goods*: consumption alternatives. Demand increases if
    the price of a substitute good increases.


** Other determinants of demand (and III)

- *Market size*: the higher is the amount of consumers, the higher is
  the demand.

- Consumers *tastes and preferences*.

- Consumers *expectations*.


** Shifts of demand (I)

- When the only change is the price of a good, there is a *movement
  along* the demand curve; the *quantity demanded* varies.

- If another determinant of demand changes, there is a *shift* of
  demand; *demand* increases or decreases.


** Shifts of demand (II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1C_1004-d5-*.pdf 0.45

- Demand curve.

- At the market price $P_A$ the quantity demanded is $Q_A$.


** Shifts of demand (III)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1C_1004-d6-*.pdf 0.45

- Increase in demand.

- At the same price, $P_A$, consumers demand a higher quantity.


** Shifts of demand (IV)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1C_1004-d7-*.pdf 0.45

- Another way of analysing an increase of demand.

- Consumers are willing to pay more for the same quantity.


** Shifts of demand (and V)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1C_1004-d8-*.pdf 0.45

- Increase in demand: \[D \rightarrow D^{+}\]

- Decrease in demand: \[D \rightarrow D^{-}\]


* Supply


** Quantity supplied and price

- The *quantity supplied* of a good is the one sellers can and want to
  sell in a certain period of time.

- The price of a good is one of the determinants of the quantity
  supplied.

- In a competitive market, as the price of the good increases the
  quantity supplied increases.


** The table and curve of individual supply

- Indicate the quantity a firm wants to sell at each possible price.

- The supply curve has positive slope.

  #+begin_center
  #+MATS: fig fig-1C_1004-otab-*.pdf
  #+end_center


** Market supply curve

- Sum of the quantity supplied by each producer at each possible
  price.

- The market supply curve is the horizontal sum of the individual
  supply curves.


** Variations in the price

#+MATS: figcol fig-1C_1004-s2-*.pdf 0.45

- A variation in the price, /ceteris paribus/, is reflected in a
  movement along the supply curve.


** Other determinants of supply (I)

- *Price of the factors of production*: if the price of a factor of
  production increases, the costs increase and the benefits fall. The
  quantity supplied decreases when the price of the factors increases.

- *Technology*: an improvement in the technology used to produce the
  good reduces production costs, so that the quantity supplied by
  firms increases.


** Other determinants of supply (and II)

- *Market size*: the higher is the number of producers, the higher is
  the supply.

- Producers *expectations*.


** Shifts of supply (I)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1C_1004-s3-*.pdf 0.45

- An increase in supply.

- Firms offer now a higher quantity at the same price.


** Shifts of supply (and II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1C_1004-s4-*.pdf 0.45

- Increase in supply: \[S \rightarrow S^{+}\]

- Decrease in supply: \[S \rightarrow S^{-}\]


* Equilibrium


** Equilibrium

- At the *equilibrium price* the quantity demanded coincides with the
  quantity supplied.

- The equilibrium price *empties the market*:

  + Buyers have bought everything they wanted to buy.

  + Sellers have sold everything they wanted to sell.


** Equilibrium price

#+MATS: figcol fig-1C_1004-eq1-*.pdf 0.45

- The intersection between supply and demand determines the
  equilibrium price and quantity.

    \[ D(P^*) = S(P^*) \]

** Example

#+MATS: figcol fig-1C_1004-eq2-*.pdf 0.45

- $Q^d = 10 - P$

- $Q^s = 5/3 + 2/3 P$


** Surplus

#+MATS: figcol fig-1C_1004-eq3-*.pdf 0.45

- When the price exceeds the equilibrium price, sellers do not sell
  all the production.


** Shortage

#+MATS: figcol fig-1C_1004-eq4-*.pdf 0.45


- When the price is below the equilibrium price, production is lower
  than the quantity consumers are willing to buy.



** Exchange points

#+MATS: figcol fig-1C_1004-eq5-*.pdf 0.45

- For non-equilibrium prices, the quantity exchanged is determined by the
  shorter side of the market.

- Out of the equilibrium, one of the parts of the market is not
  satisfied.


** Equilibrium stability

- In situations out of equilibrium the forces of supply and demand tend
  to re-establish the equilibrium.

- If the price is too high, the surplus pushes the price down.

- If the price is too low, the shortage pushes the price up.


** Comparative statics

- How to predict the effects of the change in a variable on the market
  equilibrium?

  1. We determine which curve (or curves) is affected by the change.

  2. We determine in which direction each curve moves.

  3. We compare the initial equilibrium with the new one.


** An increase in demand

#+MATS: figcol fig-1C_1004-comp1-*.pdf 0.45

- The equilibrium price increases.

- The equilibrium quantity increases.


** A decrease in supply

#+MATS: figcol fig-1C_1004-comp2-*.pdf 0.45

- The equilibrium price increases.

- The equilibrium quantity decreases.


** Shifts in both curves (I)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1C_1004-comp3-*.pdf 0.45

- Large increase in demand.

- Small decrease in supply.

- Equilibrium price and quantity increase.


** Shifts in both curves (II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-1C_1004-comp4-*.pdf 0.45

- Small increase in demand.

- Large decrease in supply.

- Equilibrium price increases, but quantity decreases.


** Shifts in both curves (and III)
- When both curves shift simultaneously, the results depend on the
  magnitude of the changes in both curves.

- If we do not have more details, we can just predict the direction of
  the change in one of the variables.
