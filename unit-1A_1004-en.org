* Introduction


** What is economics?

- The study of the *decisions* economic agents make in an
  *scarcity* environment.


** Positive economics and normative economics

- *Positive economics*: How does the economy /work/?

- *Normative economics*: How /should/ the economy /work/?


** Microeconomics and macroeconomics

- *Microeconomics* studies how *economic agents* make decisions and
  interact in the *markets*.

- *Macroeconomics* focuses on issues related to the economic system as
  a whole: *unemployment*, *inflation*, *economic growth*, etc.


** Fundamental economic problems

- *What* to produce?

- *How* to produce?

- *For whom* to produce?


** Thinking as an economist

- Consider all the *alternatives*.

- Evaluate the *costs* and *benefits* of each alternative.

- Economic agents respond to the *incentives* they face.

- Consider how different economic agents *interact*.


** Costs and Benefits

- Not all the costs and benefits correspond to monetary payments.

- *Opportunity cost*.


* Economic models


** Models

- A *model* is a simplified representation of a part of reality.


** Example: Map of the UJI

#+ATTR_LATEX: :options scale=0.35
#+MATS: figcol UJI.png 0.6

- What makes a model useful?

  + Selection.

  + Simplification.


** Models and reality (I)

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Robinson][Joan Robinson]]

#+ATTR_LATEX: :options scale=0.3
#+MATS: figcol joan_robinson_small.png 0.35

#+begin_tightquote
  "A model which took account of all the variation of reality would be
  of no more use than a map at the scale of one to one."
#+end_tightquote


** Models and reality (and II)

- If a model predictions are reliable, the realism of its
  assumptions is not so important.

- Even if a model does not produce correct predictions, it can still
  offer useful guidelines to improve the decision-making process.


** Economic models

- *Rational behaviour*.

- *Equilibrium*.

- *Marginal analysis*
