* Consumer preferences

** Introduction

- We use some assumptions to describe consumer preferences.


** Completeness (I)

- *Completeness*: the consumer is able to rank any two baskets
  according to his preferences.

** Completeness (and II)

- When comparing two baskets, $A$ and $B$, the consumer either:

  + prefers $A$ to $B$: $A \succ B$;

  + prefers $B$ to $A$: $B \succ A$; or

  + is indifferent between them: $A \sim B$.


** Non-satiation (I)

- *Non-satiation*: the consumer prefers baskets containing at least
  more units of one of the goods and no less of the other goods.


** Non-satiation (and II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-06_1004-ci02-*.pdf 0.5

- $M \succ A$.

- $A \succ P$.


** Indifference curves (I)

- An *indifference curve* comprises consumption bundles that are
  indifferent to each other.

- Each bundle belongs to an indifference curve.


** Indifference curves (II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-06_1004-ci03b-*.pdf 0.5

- The indifference curve has negative slope.

- All bundles on the curve are indifferent to $A$:
  \[ A \sim B \sim C \]


** Indifference curves (and III)

#+MATS: figcol fig-06_1004-ci06-*.pdf 0.5

- $M \succ A$.


- $A \succ P$.


** Transitivity (I)

- *Transitivity*:

  + $A \succ B$ and $B \succ C$, then $A \succ C$.

  + If $A \sim B$ and $B \sim C$, then $A \sim C$.


** Transitivity (II)

- If the assumption of transitivity is fulfilled:

  + Each basket belongs to one and *only* one indifference curve.

  + Indifference curves do not cross.


** Transitivity (and III)

#+MATS: figcol fig-06_1004-tr01-*.pdf 0.5

- If the indifference curves intersect, preferences would be
  inconsistent:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[B \sim C \text{\ and\ } C \sim A\text{, but\ } B \succ A.\]
  #+end_export


** The indifference curve map

#+MATS: figcol fig-06_1004-map01-*.pdf 0.5

- The *indifference curve map* represents the preferences of a
  consumer.


** The Marginal Rate of Substitution (I)

- The *Marginal Rate of Substitution*, $\RMS$, is the maximum number
  of units of good $Y$ that the consumer would be willing to trade for
  an additional unit of good $X$.


** The Marginal Rate of Substitution (II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-06_1004-rms01-*.pdf 0.5

- The $\RMS$ is the rate at which a consumer could substitute a good
  for another, staying on the same indifference curve.
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \RMS \approx \left| \frac{\Delta Y}{\Delta X} \right|_{I_0} \]
  #+end_export


** The Marginal Rate of Substitution (and III)

#+MATS: figcol fig-06_1004-rms02-*.pdf 0.5

- At every point of the indifference curve, the $\RMS$ coincides with
  the slope with negative sign.


** Convexity

#+MATS: figcol fig-06_1004-rms03-*.pdf 0.5

- *Convexity*: $\RMS$ is decreasing:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \RMS(A) > \RMS(B) \]
  #+end_export

- The more units of a good the consumer has, the less he values an
  additional unit.


** Regular preferences

- *Completeness*.

- *Transitivity*.

- *Non-satiation*.

- *Convexity*.

- Other technical assumptions.



* Special cases


** Perfect substitutes

#+MATS: figcol fig-06_1004-nreg01-*.pdf 0.5

- $X$ and $Y$ are *perfect substitutes*.


** Perfect complements

#+MATS: figcol fig-06_1004-nreg02-*.pdf 0.5

- $X$ and $Y$ are *perfect complements*.


** Neutrals

#+MATS: figcol fig-06_1004-nreg03-*.pdf 0.5

- $Y$ is a *neutral good*.


** Bads

#+MATS: figcol fig-06_1004-nreg04-*.pdf 0.5

- $X$ is a *bad*.




* Utility function


** The utility function
- The *utility function* assigns a number to every bundle so that more
  preferred bundles get higher numbers than the less preferred:

  + if $A \succ B$, then $U(X_A, Y_A) > U(X_B, Y_B)$;

  + if $A \sim B$, then $U(X_A, Y_A) = U(X_B, Y_B)$.


** The utility function and indifference curves

- The utility function assigns the same number to all baskets which
  are indifferent to each other.
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ U(X, Y) = \overline{U} \]
  #+end_export


** Ordinal utility (I)

#+MATS: figcol fig-06_1004-map02-*.pdf 0.45

- The utility function labels each indifference curve with a different
  number.


** Ordinal utility (II)

#+MATS: figcol fig-06_1004-map03-*.pdf 0.48

- There is an infinite number of utility functions that exactly
  represent the same preferences.

- $V(X, Y) = \sqrt{U(X, Y)}$


** Ordinal utility (and III)

- The values produced by the utility function have no measurement
  units nor any special meaning.

- Those values are only useful to *order* the different bundles
  according to the consumer's preferences.



** Marginal utility (I)

- The *marginal utility* of a good measures the variation in a
  consumer’s utility due to a change in the consumption level of that
  good, /keeping constant the consumption levels of all other goods/.
  #+begin_export latex
  \[
    \UMX = \frac{\partial U(X, Y)}{\partial X}; \quad
    \UMY = \frac{\partial U(X, Y)}{\partial Y}
  \]
  #+end_export


** Marginal utility (and II)

- If the assumption of non-satiation is fulfilled:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \UMX > 0; \quad \UMY > 0. \]
  #+end_export


** Marginal utility and the MRS (I)

- Variation in utility when simultaneously change the consumption
  levels of $X$ and $Y$ :
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \diff U = \UMX\; \diff X + \UMY\; \diff Y \]
  #+end_export

- $\diff U = 0$ if the change occurs along an indifference curve:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ 0 = \UMX\; \diff X + \UMY\; \diff Y \]
  #+end_export


** Marginal utility and the MRS (and II)

- The slope of the indifference curve is:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[
    \left. \frac{\diff Y}{\diff X} \right|_{U=\overline{U}} =
    -\frac{\UMX}{\UMY}
  \]
  #+end_export

- The marginal rate of substitution coincides with the ratio of
  marginal utilities:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ \RMS =  \frac{\UMX}{\UMY} \]
  #+end_export


* Some utility functions


** The Cobb-Douglas utility function

- The *Cobb-Douglas* utility function:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ U(X, Y) = c X^a Y^b; \quad a,b,c > 0. \]
  #+end_export

- Marginal utilities:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[
    \UMX = c a X^{a-1} Y^b; \quad
    \UMY = c b X^a Y^{b-1}.
  \]
  #+end_export

- Marginal rate of substitution:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[
    \RMS = \frac{a}{b} \frac{Y}{X}
  \]
  #+end_export


** Perfect substitutes

- Perfect substitutes:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ U(X, Y) = a X + b Y; \quad a, b > 0. \]
  #+end_export

- Marginal utilities:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[
    \UMX = a; \quad
    \UMY = b.
  \]
  #+end_export

- Marginal rate of substitution:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[
    \RMS = \frac{a}{b}
  \]
  #+end_export


** Perfect complements

- Perfect complements:
  #+begin_export latex
  \[ U(X, Y) = \min\{a X, b Y\}; \quad a, b > 0. \]
  #+end_export

- Marginal utilities: they are not well-defined at every point of the
  indifference curves.


- Marginal rate of substitution: it is not well-defined at every point
  of the indifference curves.
